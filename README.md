# ST231 Spring 2023

Course notes are organized as a [quarto book](https://db7-coursenotes.github.io/ST231_S23/).

Notes are still in progress as the semester goes on. I will use github commit messages to indicate changes, with `feat:` meaning that new material was added and `edit:` meaning that wording/presentation were modified. For students who are reading ahead, this means that you will know whether to check for new content.

Lecture slides and worked exercises/tutorials may be added during the Winter 2024 semester.
