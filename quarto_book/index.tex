You can use either RStudio or syzygy for this course, RStudio has many
fantastic bells and whistles that help you produce results and reports,
whereas syzygy has an online interface and makes it easy to use without
installing R on your own computer.

For lectures, I will be using VSCode, which is the main program that I
use because it works well with python and R, as well as other languages
that I need. I will switch to RStudio for many demonstrations just to
show you how it works because this is the program that most people who
do statistics will use. I will occasionally demonstrate some concepts
using Jupyter notebooks because this is another common way that people
do statistics and data science. You will not be tested on the features
of Rtudio, VSCode or Jupyter notebooks, but mastery of RStudio will be
extremely helpful for all future data analysis tasks beyond this course.

\hypertarget{defining-statistics}{%
\section{Defining ``Statistics''}\label{defining-statistics}}

My definition: Statistics is the study of \textbf{variance} (or
uncertainty).

\pspace

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The big question: is 1 \textbf{statistically different} from
  100?\pause

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    1 vs.~100 apples? Yes.
  \item
    1 vs.~100 atoms in an apple? No.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Many definitions of statistics are based on data. This completely misses
theoretical statistics, and makes it seem like it's all about dealing
with data. I think a better definition of statistics is that it's the
study of variance, whether that means studying the theoretical
properties of variance or trying to explain variance in a data set.

I like to ask the question is one statistically different from 100. It
may seem like they are obviously different things, but consider the
context. If you're comparing numbers of apples, then yes, one apple is
very different from having 100 apples. However, if we're looking at
numbers of of atoms per apple than one and 100 are both imperceptible
numbers of atoms and thus we might say they're practically the same. The
difference in these two examples is the scale, and variance is a great
way to measure the scale of things. In my opinion, the main thing we
learned in this course is how to tell whether to numbers are different,
given the scale of those two numbers.

In my lecture notes, I use bold font for anything that you will be
expected to be able to explain or define. You won't necessarily be able
to find it the first time you see it, but by the midterm/final it is
something I expect you to know. A good way to study in this course is to
keep a glossary of all of the words I've put in bold, with a definition
that you update as we learn more about that concept. And, of course,
write a description as if you're teaching someone else!

\item
  Give context to different numbers.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The size of the difference depends on the context.\lspace
  \end{itemize}
\item
  We need to know \emph{how} and \emph{why} we were wrong.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{How}: What is the magnitude of the difference?
  \item
    \emph{Why}: Are we missing relationships? Bad sampling? Fundamental
    randomness?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\pspace

Variance is information!

Variance comes from many sources. We might just be doing something wrong
and missing out on important feature of our data, we might be collecting
the data in a biased or incorrect way, or there might be some
fundamental part of the problem that we will never be able to measure
perfectly, and so the variance that we calculated may already be the
smallest possible variance for this problem.

I like to see that variances information. Think about an example, we're
trying to figure out the heights of undergraduate students. We can
calculate an average height, but it is entirely possible that nobody in
our data set is exactly the average height. We would want to quantify
how much variation there is around that average height. If our sample
includes a basketball team, then, this is variation due to some thing
that we could have measured. In other words, the variation in our data
can be explained by including another perspective. Once we have that
perspective and we were included in our analysis are variance should be
smaller, and that we have extracted more information. As we gain more
information about our data, the variance in our estimate goes down -
this is why I say that variance is information!

\hypertarget{descriptive-versus-inferential-statistics}{%
\section{Descriptive Versus Inferential
Statistics}\label{descriptive-versus-inferential-statistics}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Descriptive statistics} are used to explore the data.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Graphs/figures
  \item
    Numbers\lspace
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Inferential statistics} relate our data to the
  \textbf{population}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Must have a good \textbf{sample} first!
  \item
    Our sample has a mean. The population has a mean. How different do
    we expect them to be?

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \textbf{how different}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In this course, we will learn about two classes of statistics.
Descriptive statistics are the ones that we used to describe the sample
that we obtained. This can include things like the mean/median/mode, the
variance or the interquartile range, as well as bar charts, histograms
box, plots, etc.

Inferential statistics are numbers that we calculate that we think have
a relationship to the population. For instance, if we calculate the mean
of our data, and we trust that our sample is good, then we expect this
sample mean to be somewhat close to the population mean. Any time in
this course I talk about the difference between two things. I will
always mean it with reference to the variance. In this, since we have a
sample mean, as well as some measure of its variance, and this variance
tells us how similar we expect the sample mean to be to the population
mean. If we have a small sample variance, it means that we have a lot of
information about the population mean. Variance is information!

In this course, we're going to start by talking about descriptive
statistics and work our way to inferential statistics.

Let me introduce you to a dataset that I'm going to be returning to
throughout the semester. This is called the Palmer penguins data, end it
contains information on penguins from several islands in Antarctica. In
the slides, I use some fancier code to only show some of the data, but
I'll display the full data set with simpler code below:

factors contribute to body mass, species or biological sex. It's not

The type of variable is extremely important for choosing the right
summary of the data.

Categorical variables consist of two or more mutually exclusive
categories, that is, each observation has a label and nothing has more
than one label. Categorical variables may be ordered (such as ``low'',
``medium'', and ``high'') or unordered (such as names or student
numbers; putting names in alphabetical order is not usually meaningful
for summarising the data or doing the analysis).

Binary variables are a special case of categorical variables, which only
have two categories.

The distinction between categorical and quantitative isn't always this
obvious, but can be very helpful for choosing the right kind of plot or
numerical summary.

just a name (category)!

If there are only counts of 0, 1, and 2, you might want to consider the
counts as categories.

\end{tcolorbox}

There are a couple gray areas when talking about variable types. The
distinction between categorical and quantitative isn't always perfectly
clear. For example, student numbers are names, but they are completely
made up of numbers. However, you wouldn't treat these numbers as if one
student number comes after another in the same way that you wouldn't put
students in an order based on their names. You technically can do this
if you do it alphabetically or order the student numbers in order, but
this isn't a meaningful ordering. It's not like one student number is
larger than another student number, and taking the meaning of student
numbers wouldn't make any sense.

Another gray area is a counting variable that has low counts. For
example, if you only have zero one or two children as possible values,
tt might make more sense to look at all of the people with zero
children, look at all the people with one child, and then look at all
the people with two children, rather than making a plot that treats the
number of children as if it can be any value between zero and infinity.

\hypertarget{individuals-subjects}{%
\section{Individuals (Subjects)}\label{individuals-subjects}}

\textbf{Individual:} the unit of study.

In the Palmer Penguins data set, a penguin is an individual.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Spousal pairs - the pairs are the individuals?
\item
  Before/after (e.g., weight loss) - people are individuals.
\end{itemize}

\end{tcolorbox}

All of the variables we just talked about our measured on individuals.
That is to say an individual is what you are measuring when collecting
data. This can take the form of a single penguin, in which case it's
obvious that this body mass belongs to this penguin; we have measured
this body mass on this.

There are some gray areas to this as well, though. For example, if we're
measuring carbon dioxide every month, then we're actually measuring
carbon dioxide as the variable and months as the individuals, and we can
measure other things on those individuals if needed.

We will also encounter pared observations in this course, which our
measurements on two things at once. For example, we might be looking at
spousal pairs, perhaps measuring the number of children per pair. The
variable we are measuring is the number of children, and so we must have
one observation of the number of children per individual, which means
that the individuals must be the pairs of people. I slightly more
obvious example is something like a weight loss study were observing a
change in weight for a certain person, even though we have two
observations, the individual is still the person who were measuring.

Compare this to the output of \texttt{table(mtcars\$am)}.

Bar charts are primarily used to compare categories. The most common use
of a bar chart is to count the number of observations in each category,
and create a bar with a corresponding height. In this example, we see,
automatic and manual transmissions, with automatic labelled as zero and
manual labelled as one. We can see that approximately 22 cars are
automatic and 13 cars are manual. Unlike a pie chart, we can read these
numbers off of the plot and it's easy to compare these two categories.

The code required to create this bar chart as shown on the left. The
data set is built into our so we don't need to load anything to put this
data. We do need to load in the \texttt{ggplot} library, though. In my
lecture notes, you'll see lots of code that looks like this, but you
will not be tested on your ability to re-create this code. For those
interested, here's a quick breakdown of the functions I used:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The ggplot function tells R what data we will be using.
\item
  The \texttt{aes()} function sets up the plot ``aesthetics'', such as
  what variable goes on the x-axis, what variable goes on the y-axis,
  what variable is assigned to a colour, what variable determines the
  shapes of points etc.
\item
  \texttt{geom\_bar()} actually makes the bar plot using the data set
  that \texttt{ggplot()} set up and the aesthetics, that \texttt{aes()}
  set up.
\item
  The \texttt{labs()} function simply adds labels to the plot to make it
  look nicer.
\end{itemize}

What type of variable is ``dose level'', defined as either no dose, half
dose, or full dose? They aren't whole numbers, but we can't measure them
with greater precision!

\end{tcolorbox}

Quantitative variables are split into discrete and continuous variables.
Discrete variables are generally represented by whole numbers, for
example, the number of students in a given classroom.

In contrast, continuous numbers could be anything! I like to think of
them as numbers that could've been measured with more precision if we
had better tools. For example, peoples Heights could be measured to
infinite precision if we had perfect tools, whereas we don't need better
tools to measure the number of children and family more precisely.

Of course, as with all things, there is a gray area here. Many studies
will choose to give their subjects either no dose, a half dose or a full
dose. These are obviously numbers and it is very likely that the
response for a 0.75 dose is somewhere in between the half dose and the
full dose. However, we chose these numbers and thus there are only three
possible numbers. No amount of measuring is going to give us something
other than a half dose (any deviation in administration of the dose can
hopefully be ignored for the purpose of the study). In the definitions
we've used it is neither a whole number, nor cannot be measured with
higher precision. For the purposes of visualization, we might actually
want to use a bar chart as if this were a categorical variable. If the
dose had more categories and we expected the response to have a smooth
trend across different dose levels, then we might use visualizations
meant for discrete data. If the dose could have been any number between
zero and one then we might use visualization meant for continuous data.

This plot demonstrates why bar chart isn't appropriate for these data.
We can see that each data point essentially gets its own bar, and so the
heights are no longer meaningful. The exception is that these data are
rounded, and so some lengths end up in the same bar. Knowing that some
of our data are rounded to the same value is not necessarily meaningful
for any analyses that we might want to do. Instead, we would like a
chart that shows us where most of the data are, and whether or not they
are clear patterns in these data.

Bins are (0,1{]}, (1,2{]}, (2,3{]}\ldots{}

Notice how the y-axis is still ``Counts'' (like a bar chart).

Most of the time we will probably want to use a histogram to display
quantitative, continuous data. A histogram is very much like putting
continuous numbers into discrete bins, and then showing it as a bar
chart. In this example, I chose bins from 1 to 3, then 3 to 5, then 5 to
7, and so on. For the bar on this histogram centred at a shark length of
12 we can see that there were five observations between 11 and 13. Note
that the definitions of bins has a round bracket on the left side and
the square bracket on the right side, this is to say that the left end
point \emph{is not} included but the right end point \emph{is} included.
This is just to account for cases where X may fall directly on the
border between two bins, and we have to choose which bin. The actual bin
we choose is arbitrary kind of like driving in the left or the right.
You will not be tested on whether you can remember which endpoint is
inclusive.

From the plot on the right, we can see that most of the sharks are
around 16 feet in length with sun going down to 10 feet and some as long
as around 22 feet. The plot has a nice bell shape.

A simple version of the plot can be made as follows, where
\texttt{ggplot} chooses the bins automatically. Note that this is rarely
desireable, and you should almost always choose the bins yourself.

In the previous slide, it looked like the distribution of sharks
followed a nice bell curve. However, if we use bins that are 1.5 units
wide we get a plot that looks fairly different. It still looks like most
sharks are around 16 feet and some go down to 10 and some go as high is
22 or 23, But we see a large bar that covers 12 to 13.5. This no longer
has a nice bell shaped to it, but still looks relatively the same.

With histograms the bins that you choose are extremely important. Most
software have default values that are generally reasonable, But it's
always always always worth investigating other bins.

\hypertarget{describing-distributions}{%
\section{Describing Distributions}\label{describing-distributions}}

When you're asked to comment on a histogram, always mention the
following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Shape}: \textbf{Unimodal}/\textbf{bimodal} and
  \textbf{skewness}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Skewness: put a glob of peanut butter on toast, ``skew'' it to one
    side.\lspace
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Center}: midpoint (\textbf{mean}/\textbf{median})

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Mode} depends on the bin!
  \item
    Skewness shows up in the relation between mean and median: ``Mean
    less (than median) means left (skew).''\lspace
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Spread}: the
  \textbf{range}/\textbf{variance}/\textbf{IQR}\lspace

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    More on IQR later!\lspace
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Outliers}: points that don't fit the shape

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    More on outliers when we cover IQR!
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

There are many shapes that a histogram can show. A distribution can be
skewed (or ``heavy-tailed''), which means that it looks like a bell
curve but one side has a longer/thicker tail. We also want to know about
several measures of the center of the distribution, as well as how
spread out it is. Outliers are also something interesting to note;
outliers are something that are \emph{not} part of the shape (so you
wouldn't consider them when evaluating the skewness of a distribution).

Try drawing out each of these shapes/patterns!

\hypertarget{example-what-is-the-shape}{%
\section{Example: What is the Shape?}\label{example-what-is-the-shape}}

\includegraphics{L01-Intro_PicturingGraphs_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-13-1.pdf}

This represents a \textbf{bimodal} distribution because it has two peaks
(the word ``mode'' can refer to the category with the most observations,
but it can also refer to the top of a peak). This would be described as
a bimodal distribution with centres around 190 and 215, ranges around
195 to 205 and 205 to 235, with both peaks being symmetric and without
any outliers.

\hypertarget{example-what-is-the-shape-1}{%

Shape?}\label{example-what-is-the-shape-1}}

\includegraphics{L01-Intro_PicturingGraphs_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-14-1.pdf}

This is the classic sort of gotcha question that I like to use. This is
actually a bar chart that I modified so that the bars have no space
in-between - the x-labels are categories, not ranges! It may look
somewhat symmatric and unimodal without any outliers, but the x-labels
are actually out of order. These numbers are actually just numerical
encodings of species names - 1 refers to Adelie penguins, 2 refers to
Chinstrap, and 3 refers to Gentoo. These numbers were applied
alphabetically because there isn't really a logical way to order these
species: they're unordered categories!

So, basically, it does not make sense to talk about shape in a bar graph
where the labels could have been put in any order!

This visualization technique is shown purely for pedagogical reasons. A
stem and leaf plot is like a histogram where the bins are all powers of
10. It isisplayed using the stem, which is the first digit and the leaf
which is the second digit. For example, the number 78 has a 7 in the
tens place (and were using the tens place as the stem) and an 8 in the
ones place (and we using the ones place as the leaf). In the stem and
leaf plot, 78 goes on the stem labelled 70 and it gets a leaf of eight.
Going the other way, we can see a stem labelled 90 and a leaf labelled
eight which corresponds to the number 98. For the stem labelled zero we
have the numbers one and four, for the stem label 10 we have the numbers
12, 12, 12, and 15, and so on.

Essentially, this is just a histogram. We're instead of drawing a bar
that corresponds to the number of observations in that bin, we are just
listing the observations in that bin. Compare the stem and leaf plot to
the sideways histogram on the right: in the first bin from 0 to 10 (not
including 10) there are two numbers, one and four, and the length of the
bin is two. For the stem label 20, we have the numbers 21, 23, 25 and
26, and this is displayed as a bar with link for in the histogram.

The main reason for showing this visualization technique is that it can
be very useful for tests and quizzes, because it allows you to create a
histogram without software. It also allows easy computation of the
median since all of the leaves are in order. These are not used in
practice, because in practice, you will have software to create
histograms \emph{and} find the median!

Note that the shape of the distribution can be seen from the stem and
leaf plot. It is a unimodal distribution that is right skewed and likely
does not have an outlier (there is one point that appears to be separate
from the others, but this is likely due to bin choice).

We cannot know the population parameter!

If we were able to measure the height of every Canadian at this very
instant, we would get one value. We can't do this though, so we collect
a sample instead. We try to collect the sample in such a way that we get
value close to the population parameter.

In this course, we make a big distinction between population parameter
and sample statistic. A sample statistic is something that we calculate
from a sample, where is the population? Parameter is the value that we
would get if we had the whole population.

Most of this course is centred around using the sample statistic to get
an idea of what the population parameter might be.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Where are ``most'' of the data?\lspace
\item
  If we took an individual at random, what's the ``best guess'' of their
  height?\lspace
\end{itemize}

\pspace

We want to \textbf{summarize} the data using a few words/numbers.

I prefer the second description here - if I were to make a prediction, I
want my predicted value to be close to the actual value. For example, I
might want to design something that fits the average person's height. I
must make a prediction about the height of the people that will use it.
My prediction is chosen to minimize how far off I would be, which means
that I want to be near the ``centre''.

\hypertarget{centre-1-the-median}{%
\section{Centre 1: The Median}\label{centre-1-the-median}}

The \textbf{median} (\(M\)) is the midpoint of a distribution: half the
observations are smaller and the other half are larger than it. To find
the median: \pspace

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Arrange all observations in order of size, from smallest to largest.
\item
  If the number of observations (\(n\)) is odd, the median \(M\) is the
  centre observation in the ordered list. Find the location of the
  median by counting \((n + 1)/2\) observations up from the smallest
  observation.
\item
  If n is even, the median \(M\) halfway between the two centre
  observations in the ordered list. The location of the median is again
  \((n + 1)/2\), counting from the smallest observation in the list.
\end{enumerate}

Basically, the median is the middle value. With odd \(n\), the middle
value is one of the observations, but when \(n\) is even we have to go
in between two values.

The distribution of needle lengths is how species of pine trees are
characterized. The following data are the lengths (in cm) of a sample of
15 needles taken at random from different parts of several Aleppo pine
trees (Southern California). What is the median length?

\begin{verbatim}
7.20 7.60  8.50  8.50  8.70  9.00  9.00 9.30

noticeably different Torrey pine species. What is the median length for
these 18 pine needles? The ordered data are:

\end{verbatim}

All three have the same median!

\pspace

Do the ``centres'' make sense? Do they provide a good summary?

These three data sets demonstrate that the median only depends on the
middle two numbers when \(n\) is odd. For the first two data sets, the
median does seem to describe centre of the data well. The last data set
is a little bit different from the others and the median might not be
enough information.

\hypertarget{the-mean}{%
\section{The Mean}\label{the-mean}}

The mean is defined as:

\[
\bar x = \frac{1}{n}(x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n)= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nx_i
\]

For example, the mean of (1, 2, 3, 4) is \[
\frac{1}{4}(1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5
\] (this also happens to be the median!)

This formula for the mean may look a little bit scary, but all it means
is that we add up all of the values that we have and divide by the
number of values.

Create a couple examples yourself and find the mean! If you create a
list of values, you can use R to check your work as follows:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    An object is just a thing. You can put two things together, do a
    function of a thing, etc.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{my\_values} is a \emph{vector}. That is, it's a collection of
  values.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We create it using the \texttt{c()} function, which means
    ``concatenate'', or ``put together''.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The mean function takes a vector and calculates the mean for you.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-mean-is-not-robust}{%

Consider the following sets of data:

\begin{verbatim}
Set 1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Set 2: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 60
\end{verbatim}

\pspace

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Both have the same median.\lspace
\item
  Mean of 3.5 and 12.5, respectively.
\end{itemize}

\pspace

Which do you think is the correct measure of the centre?

Unlike the median, which only depends on the middle value, the mean uses
information from all of the values. This means that if there's an
outlier or a misrecorded point, the mean will reflect this. Sometimes
this is what we want and sometimes it is not.

A common example of when the mean is not what we want is income. The
lowest possible income is zero, but there is no maximum income, so
incomes tend to be right skewed. The right skew affects the mean a lot
more than that affects the median, and so, in this case the median is a
better measure of the most common levels of income.

The app above will be used in class, so do not worry if you're unable to
run it. It demonstrates that when they mean is less than the median it
means it's left skewed. The reason for this is that the outliers to the
left affect the mean more than they affect the median.

\end{verbatim}

\pspace

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  All have the same \textbf{range} (max - min).
\end{itemize}

These three data sets all have the same mean and median, but just
looking at them shows that they are differnt collections of numbers. The
first said, only has two unique values put those values are relatively
far away from each other compared to the other sets. The second set is a
more even spread from one to five. The third set has for value is equal
to the mean and two values that may be outliers.

To me, the first set looks like it's the most variable because all of
the values are very far away from either the mean or the median. The
second set has a smaller variance, because there are values closer to
the mean. And the last set I expect to have the lowest variance, because
most values are actually equal to the mean.

The formula for the variance, which will introduce next, matches this
intuition. However, many students have different intuitions about which
has the most variance and those are valid as well but are harder to
quantify.

\hypertarget{measure-of-spread-the-variance}{%

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The distances to the mean are all -2 or 2

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If we found the mean, we'd get 0! We need to make sure they're all
    positive.\lspace
  \end{itemize}
\item

  the mean is 2.\lspace
\item

    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{variance} is the average \emph{squared} distance to the
mean!

(We use squared because math - more on this later).

We are basically looking at the average deviation from the mean. We want
that deviation to be positive and there are several ways to do this. We
have settled on squaring the numbers for the same reason we drive on the
right side of the road: it's just convention. There are benefits to
using the absolute distance from the mean, but there are many
mathematical advantages to squaring the values first.

\hypertarget{variance-formula}{%
\section{Variance Formula}\label{variance-formula}}

\vspace{1.5cm}

\[
s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)^2
\]

\pspace

We use \(n-1\) because of math reasons.

The easiest way to calculate this is to put it in a table:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
\(i\) & \(x_i\) & \(x_i - \bar x\) & \((x_i - \bar x)^2\) \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
1 & 1 & -2 & 4 \\
2 & 1 & -2 & 4 \\
3 & 1 & -2 & 4 \\
4 & 5 & 2 & 4 \\
5 & 5 & 2 & 4 \\
6 & 5 & 2 & 4 \\
\(\sum\) & 18 & 0 & 24 \\
\end{longtable}

The mean is 3, and the variance is 24/5 = 4.8.

In the table above, as before, the subscript \(i\) is just used to
denote different observations. For example \(x_1\) is the first
observation, \(x_2\) is the second observation in our data, and so on
(this ordering is arbitrary).

In order to calculate the variance, we must first know the mean, and so
it's convenient to put this at the bottom of the table. We then squared
the deviations from the mean and divided by \(n-1\). There are very good
technical reasons why we divide by (n-1) that we won't get into here.

As a quick explanation for \(n-1\), consider the variance of a single
observation. It doesn't vary! There's not enough information to see how
much variance there is. There isn't enough \emph{information} in our
data. The \(n-1\) in the denominator enforces this - we can't calculate
the variance of one observation.

The IQR is very closely related to the median. But first, we will learn
what quartiles are.

Consider the data:

\begin{verbatim}
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
\end{verbatim}

The median of these data is 5; 50\% of the data are to the left of this
point.

\item

  \item
    Q3: 75\% of the data are to the left.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\tightlist
\item
  Find the median

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It's 4.5. Cool.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Q1 is just half of 50\% - we're finding a median again!

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Q1 is the median of everything to the left of the median.
  \item
    In this case, 1 2 3 4 are the numbers to the left of the median, and
    so Q1 is 2.5.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  By a similar argument, Q3 is 6.5.
\end{enumerate}

Q0 is where 0\% of the data are to the left. In other words, it's the
minimum value in the data! Similarly, Q4 is the maximum value in the
data.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, opacitybacktitle=0.6, left=2mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-warning-color!10!white, colframe=quarto-callout-warning-color-frame, breakable, toptitle=1mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-warning-color}{\faExclamationTriangle}\hspace{0.5em}{Warning}, opacityback=0, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, titlerule=0mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

The algorithm we just used for computing the quartiles is not the only
one! In R, there are \emph{NINE} different ways to calculate the
quartiles. You should stick to doing this by hand if you want to get the
WeBWork answers right.

\end{verbatim}

The quartiles give an excellent way to summarise data:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lllll@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
Q0 (min) & Q1 & Q2 (median) & Q3 & Q4 (max) \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}

1 & 4.5 & 7 & 8.5 & 12 \\
\end{longtable}

The five number summary just shows all five of the quartiles. Note that
there are five quartiles, because zero is also one of them.

For practice, make sure you can calculate the median, and then the
median of all the values to the left of it!

\pspace

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Same units as the original data\lspace
\item
  Robust to outliers (unlike the sd)!
\end{itemize}

This is the second measure of spread that we will learn. The IQR is
commonly used when we have highly skewed data or data with outliers. The
sd measures the average squared deviation from the mean, whereas the IQR
measures the middle 50\% of the data.

Notice how this is not centered on the median. Consider the following
data:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{figure}

The median of these should be at position
\((n+1)/2 = (20 + 1)/2 = 10.5\) (I used the \texttt{length()} function
in R to count the number of observations for me). This value is halfway
between 3 and 3, meaning it's 3. Q1 is the median of the first 10 data
points, which is at position 5.5, giving us a value of 2. Q3 is 5.5
positions from the end, which is 4.5. Thus the IQR is \(4.5 - 2 = 2.5\).

First, does this make sense to you? Does 2.5 sound like a reasonable
width for the middle 50\%?

Now consider that the distribution is clearly skewed to the right. This
affects the variance a lot, but the IQR would have been the same no
matter what the first 4 or last 4 values were.

\hypertarget{iqr-for-outliers}{%
\section{IQR for Outliers}\label{iqr-for-outliers}}

In this class, we use a rule of thumb for calculating outliers. Anything
that is\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Below the median minus 1.5*IQR, or
\item
  above the median plus 1.5*IQR
\end{itemize}

is considered an outlier.

This rule of thumb is not based on any mathematical derivations, it just
seems to work in most situations.

The idea is that the IQR gives a measure of spread, and the median gives
the measure of the centre, so anything too far from the centre is an
outlier. We use the spread to figure out how far away from the centre we
are willing to accept. This will show up several times in this course.
We've seen it in this example for the IQR and median because this is
simple and easy to interpret.

Most of the rest of this course will be spent looking at something
similar for the mean. We will still use this idea of the centre plus or
minus some measure of the spread, but will incorporate information about
the sample and assumptions about the population that allow us to make
much stronger conclusions beyond simply checking if something is an
outlier.

\end{itemize}

We saw the same thing a couple of times throughout this lesson. We saw
measures of centre that try to describe the middle of a distribution and
centres of spread that tell us how spread out the data are. The mean and
the sd are intrinsically linked, and the median and IQR are
intrinsically linked.

We also saw the rule-of-thumb to use IQR for finding outliers by using
the median plus-an-minus some number times the spread. You better
believe that this idea will show up again later in this course!

Boxplots are a visual representation of the five number summary. These
can be very small while still showing the shape of our data. However,
these only work for unimodal data - there isn't a good way to show a
bimodal distribution on a boxplot. Also, it is very easy to plot two
boxplots for two different data sets in order to compare the
distributions.

For assignments and exams, be ready to calculate any of these values and
compare the mean/median and sd/IQR. Also be ready to compare the five
number summary to a boxplot.

  \textbf{Spider Silk.} Spider silk is the strongest known material,
  natural or man-made, on a weight basis. A study examined the
  mechanical properties of spider silk using 21 female golden orb
  weavers, Nephila clavipes. Here are data on silk yield stress, which
  represents the amount of force per unit area needed to reach permanent
  deformation of the silk strand. The data are expressed in megapascals
  (MPa):

\item
  Describe the shape, centre, and spread of the data using a histogram
  (code below).
\item
  Find the mean and median yield stress. Compare these two values.
  Referring to the histogram produced by the code below, what general
  fact does your comparison illustrate?
\item
  Re-run the code using different values of \texttt{breaks}. What do you
  see? (Note that this example uses base R rather than \texttt{ggplot2}
  because it has simpler code - \texttt{ggplot2} has more flexibility,
  but that flexibility isn't necessary here.)
\item
  Use the \texttt{boxplot()} function to create a boxplot (you do not
  need the \texttt{breaks=10} part of the code). Compare this to the
  histogram. Also comment on any points that stand out (when there are
  outliers, R shows \(Q2\pm 1.5IQR\) rather than Q0 and Q4).
\item
  Use the \(Q2\pm 1.5IQR\) formula by hand to find the outliers, and
  verify your calculations with the R plot.

\end{itemize}

I just want to make this very clear: we are not looking for a causation.
Instead, we're just looking at whether or not to variables are related,
and we think that measurements of one will be enough to tell us about
measurements of the other. For example, if we think one variable is easy
to measure and another is harder to measure, then we might want to set
the easy to measure variable as the explanatory variable and see if it
``explains'' the harder to measure variable. This has nothing to do with
the easy to measure variable causing the hard to measure one.

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    Height does cause weight, but there are other explanations.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In these examples, we carefully use words like ``affects'', ``associated
with'', and ``tends to''. For all of these examples we would expect a
relationship of some sort, but the causality is not necessarily obvious.

We obviously expect the blood alcohol contact to affect reflex time. We
expect this to be a causal relationship.

In the mid-1900s, it was hypothesized by cigarette companies that,
rather than cigarettes causing cancer, people who were at increased risk
of lung cancer with the sorts of people who also tended to smoke.
Finding a relationship was not enough to convince people that it was
cigarettes causing lung cancer. Even though we know that there's a
relationship between cigarettes and lung cancer, the techniques we learn
in this course are not enough to conclude causality.

Height and weight are an example of how are the knowledge of one
variable tells us about the other, without there being any causal
relationship. We expect that taller people will have more mass, but
there are also other reasons why somebody might have more mass that or
not captured by their height.

In the data frame above, we have an observation of the number of power
boats registered in each year, as well as the number of manatees that
died in a collision with a powerboat in that year. The table shown above
is only a small part of the data.

The rest of the data are shown in the plot. To create this plot, we put
the number of powerboats registered on the X axis, and the number of
manatee deaths on the Y axis. The annotation on the plot demonstrates
how the points were added. One of the columns in the data is labelled
1977 and in that year they were to 755,000 powerboats registered and
they were 54 manatee deaths that year. Because these two numbers are
measured on the same individual (with the individual being the year in
this example), we know that those two numbers go together. If we had a
collection of peoples heights and a separate collection of peoples
weights, but no knowledge of which individual each was collected on,
then we would not be able to make a scatterplot. In order to make a
scatterplot, we have to know which observation on the X axis is
associated with which observation on the Y axis.

In general for this course were looking for a linear pattern. There are
other models out there that fit nonlinear patterns, but we do not cover
them in this course. There's one way for things to be linear, and there
are an infinite number of ways for things to be nonlinear. However,
there are many common ways to account for non-linearity while still
using a linear model.

Regardless of whether something is linear or has some sort of curve, we
are very interested in how strong of a pattern there is. For a linear
model this means we want the points to be very close to the line,
whereas for non-linear models we want the pattern to be very clear. We
generally want patterns to pass the ``facial impact test'', were the
pattern is so obvious that it might as well be slapping you in the face
(this is not an official test).

As with describing the shape of histograms, we treat outliers as
something that are not part of the shape. We can have a clear linear
pattern that happens to have an outlier.

The plot of manatees versus powerboats above would be described as a
strong linear pattern, perhaps with some extra variation at larger X
values.

Clearly, there's a very different pattern in each plot.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The first plot looks relatively linear with a little bit of random
  variation. For this data set a linear model does seem appropriate.
\item
  The plot at the top right she was a very clear pattern that is not
  linear, so we may be able to fit a model that accounts for this
  non-linearity.
\item
  The plot at the bottom left is almost a perfect line, but with an
  outlier. This outlier makes it so that the line that I have added to
  the plot doesn't actually go through the perfect pattern that we can
  see if that outlier weren't there.
\item
  The bottom right plot is a mess. If it weren't for the outlier, the X
  values would all be identical! In this case, a scatterplot would not
  be appropriate. If I saw this while analysing my data, I would have
  assumed that X was supposed to be either constant (e.g., all X values
  should have been 8) or categorical. In both cases, a scatterplot would
  not be appropriate.

From this point on, we're focusing on linear relationships. The plots
above both demonstrate the same linear relationship, but with different
``strength''s. Let's measure that!

\hypertarget{the-correlation-coefficient-r}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{The correlation coefficient
\(r\)}{The correlation coefficient r}}\label{the-correlation-coefficient-r}}

Recall the formula for the variance: \[
s_x^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)(x_i - \bar x) 
\]

The \textbf{correlation coefficient} is defined as: \[
r = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{x_i - \bar x}{s_x}\right)\left(\frac{y_i - \bar y}{s_y}\right)
\] where \(s_x\) is the s.d. of \(x\) and \(s_y\) is the s.d. of \(y\).

\pspace

It's like a variance for two variables at once!

This explanation might not stick for those of you who aren't a fan of
formulas, but I think this demonstrates an important aspect of the
correlation coefficient. The formula for the standard deviation includes
\((x_i - \bar x)(x_i - \bar x)\). If we replaced one of those with
\(y\), we'd get \((x_i - \bar x)(y_i - \bar y)\), which is one step
closer to the correlation coefficient. In other words, the correlation
is a measure of how two (quantitative) variables vary together!

Let's try another approach. \(x\) has variance. \(y\) has variance. They
also have variance \emph{with each other}. This is measured by the
correlation!

If neither of these explanations make sense, don't worry! We'll see
plenty of correlations and get an intuition for how correlations are
different with different data.

\hypertarget{the-range-of-r}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{The range of
\(r\)}{The range of r}}\label{the-range-of-r}}

\[
r = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{x_i - \bar x}{s_x}\right)\left(\frac{y_i - \bar y}{s_y}\right)
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(s_x\) and \(s_y\) are positive\lspace
\item

  \end{itemize}
\item
  \(x_i - \bar x\) \emph{can} be negative (same with \((y_i-\bar y)\)).
\end{itemize}

\pspace

The correlation coefficient can be anything from -1 to 1, with 0
representing no correlation and -1 and 1 representing perfect
correlation.

The fact that the correlation can be negative is important. A
correlation coefficient of -1 looks like a perfect downward slope.

It looks relatively linear. Take a moment to think of how correlated
these two variables are, and assign it a value between 0 and 1. This is
how you would guess the correlation coefficient

On exams, you will be expected to differentiate between ``not
correlated'' (about 0), ``slightly correlated'' (0.2 to 0.4), ``very
correlated'' (0.6 to 0.8), and ``near perfect correlation (almost
exactly 1)'', or the negatives of these values; you won't need to guess
whether the correlation is 0.55 or 0.6.

In R, we calculate the \(r\) with the \texttt{cor()} function.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0.8164205
\end{verbatim}

Does this number make sense to you? It seems fairly high to me, but with
small amounts of data it's not that surprising. Think of it this way: if
you removed a quarter of the data at random, would you still be able to
see the pattern? If so, then it's probably ``very correlated''!

The first point states that the order doesn't matter:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{cor}\NormalTok{(anscombe}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{y1, anscombe}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{x1)}
\end{Highlighting}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0.8164205
\end{verbatim}

However, it \emph{does} matter if we do a \emph{non-linear}
transformation, such as squaring the values. The correlation is a
measure of \textbf{linear} association, so making things non-linear will
affect it.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{plot}\NormalTok{(y1}\SpecialCharTok{\^{}}\DecValTok{2} \SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{ x1, }\AttributeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ anscombe)}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0.7992029
\end{verbatim}

For these data, squaring didn't have much of an effect (as we can see in
the plot), but we still saw a change in \(r\)! Notice that a unit change
had absolutely no effect on \(r\). In general, we either expect things
to be exactly the same or they can be completely different; very few
things are ``almost equal'' in the general case (they may be almost
equal with one set of data, but that means nothing for completely
different sets of data).

  The association is different for different X values. This is
  \emph{not} a linear relationship, which means we have to do extra work
  to make sure that we cover all the non-linearities.
\item
  This is a very strong relationship. The pattern clearly passes the

It's important to note that \(r\) can always be calculated for numeric

used 0 to represent black, 1 to represent asian, etc., then we could
technically calculate the correlation coefficient. This would be utterly

don't account for the sub-groups, we get the opposite affect! As we can
see in the plot, if we have all the groups together than it looks like a
negative correlation, but once we separate groups each individual group
has a positive correlation.

(Note that I hid the code for this plot - the code I used to ensure the
colours matched and I got the right layout is pretty advanced, and I
also used some tricks along the way.)

These notes are based on Chapter 4 of Baldi \& Moore and Chapter 6.1 to
6.3 in OpenIntro Biostats.

In linear modelling, we have a collection of pairs \(x_i\) and \(y_i\).
We think that there's some sort of relationship between \(x\) and \(y\),
and we think that a line is an adequate way to characterize that
relationship\footnote{Very few things are actually linear, but lines are
  fantastic approximations to many things.}.

Just like we assume that there's a ``true'' population mean, there is
also a ``true'' slope and intercept for the line that characterizes the
relationship between \(x\) and \(y\). In the plot below, the green line
represents the ``true'' relationship between \(x\) and \(y\), and the
data are random values above and below that line\footnote{We assume that
  \(x\) is fixed, but \(y\) has random noise. In other words, \(x\) is
  not a random variable but \(y\) is.}.

\includegraphics{L04-Regression_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf}

In high school, you may have learned a line as \(y = mx + b\). In
statistics, we often use latin letters for estimates and greek letters
for population parameters\footnote{Because we think it makes us fancy.
  Note that the Baldi \& Moore textbook uses \(a\), \(b\), and \(e\) for
  everything.}. The population line is thus:

\[
y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \epsilon_i
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\alpha\) is the \textbf{intercept}.
\item
  \(\beta\) is the \textbf{slope}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A 1 unit increase in \(x\) corresponds to a \(\beta\) increase in
    \(y\).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \(\epsilon_i\) is random noise (\(N(0,\sigma)\)).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Again, we think of \(x\) as being fixed. The random noise is above
    and below the line, not side to side.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The formula implies that \(y_i \sim N(\alpha + \beta x_i, \sigma)\),
  since \(y_i\) is centered at \(\alpha + \beta x_i\) but randomly
  varies above and below the line with variance \(\sigma^2\).
\end{itemize}

The word ``regression'' means to go backward. I like to think that we
are ``going backward'' to the population numbers from the sample
values\footnote{Actually, the word comes from ``regressing to the
  mean'', which comes from how children are closer to average height
  than their parents - they go back toward the mean. This is not
  important.}. Any situation where you are estimating a population
parameter is technically a \textbf{regression}, but this terminology is
not useful for this class.

To regress, we \textbf{estimate} the parameters using sample statistics.
For linear regression, we use regular old latin letters instead of the
fancy greek ones. \(a\) is the estimate for \(\alpha\), \(b\) for
\(\beta\), and \(e\) for \(\epsilon\). In order to do find these sample
statistics, we minimize the squared error between the line and the data:

\[e_i^2 = (y_i - a - b x_i)^2\]

In other words, we find \(a\) (for \(\alpha\)) and \(b\) (for \(\beta\))
that make the sum of the squared errors \(e_i\) as small as possible. We
use the squared errors for the same reason we use squared deviations in
the forumla for the variance: so that positive and negative values do
not cancel out\footnote{Also, because the calculus works out so much
  better.}.

The estimates \(a\) and \(b\) are as follows:

\begin{align*}
b &= rs_y/s_x\\
a &= \bar y - b\bar x
\end{align*}

These are called the \textbf{least squares} estimates\footnote{There are
  other ways to estimate these parameters, but they're outside the scope
  of this course. All regression lines that you see in the textbook and
  the notes will be least squares regression lines.}. The equation for
\(b\) is especially important!

In R, these can be calculated as follows. The \texttt{mtcars} data set
is a collection of measurements made on various cars. In this example,
we'll regress the fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon, or mpg) against
the weight of the car.

From this line, we can make \textbf{predictions} about new points by
simply plugging in the \(x\) value. For example, let's say we wanted to
guess the mpg of a car that weighs 3,000 lbs. In the data, the units for
weight are 1000 lbs, so this means plugging a value of \texttt{wt=3}
into the data.

\chapter{Regression Facts}\label{regression-facts}}

Here are some facts about the least squares regression line:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The point \((\bar x, \bar y)\) is always on the line.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Least squares regression can be seen as putting a line through
    \((\bar x, \bar y)\) and rotating it until the squared error is the
    smallest.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \(s_y\ge 0\) and \(s_x\ge 0\), so whenever \(r > 0\), we know that
  \(b > 0\).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The slope has the same sign as the correlation. Otherwise, the slope
    could be pretty much any number, regardless of the correlation.
  \item
    If \(r = 0\), then \(b = 0\), and vice versa.
  \item
    Other than the sign and the special case of \(r=0\), there is no way
    to tell the value of \(r\) if all you know is \(b\).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  For \(r\), the distinction between \(y\) and \(x\) doesn't matter.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For the regression line, it \emph{absolutely} matters!

\hypertarget{percent-of-variation-explained}{%
\chapter{Percent of Variation
Explained}\label{percent-of-variation-explained}}

Because of some mathematical quirks, \(r^2\), the squared value of
\(r\), can be interpreted as:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{The percent of variation in \(y\) that can be ``explained'' by
the linear model}.\footnote{Usually \(r^2\) is labelled \(R^2\) for
  historical reasons. Capitalization matters in math; it's just
  coincidence that both lower case and upper case mean the same thing
  here.}
\end{quote}

The value of \(r^2\) can be calculated as: \[
R^2 = r^2 = \frac{\text{Variance of the predicted }y\text{-values}}{\text{Variance of the observed }y\text{-values}}
\]

I'll explain this in steps. The first plot below shows just the values
in \(y\). This collection of values has a own mean and variance.

The second plot shows the change in variance that the line ``explains''.
Instead of deviations above and below the mean, the variance can now be
characterized as the deviations above and below the regression line.
This variance will always be lower than the variance of \(y\) without
incorporating \(x\)\footnote{Except when \(r=0\), can you explain why?}.

The third plot shows where this variance went. \emph{The line itself has
variance}; there is deviation in the line above and below the mean of
\(y\). This is the variance that gets explained by incorporating \(x\)!
If you consider one of the points in \(y\), say \(y_1\), the distance
between \(y_1\) and \(\bar y\) can be split up into the difference
between \(\bar y\) and the regression line plus the distance between the
regression line and \(y_1\).

\includegraphics{L04-Regression_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-8-1.pdf}

The rest of the variance is left \textbf{unexplianed}. No regression
will ever be perfect unless we are studing a very very simple .

To see this a different way, consider what happens when
\(r = 0\)\footnote{Therefore the slope will also be 0.}. This will just
be a horizontal line, and none of the variance is explained. On the
other had, if \(r = 1\) then all of the points will be exactly on the
line. All of the variance in \(y\) has been explained by the regression
against \(x\) - there's no variance left to be explained!\footnote{Statistics
  is \emph{still} just the study of variance.}

Notice how the R output includes

\hypertarget{prediction}{%
\section{Prediction}\label{prediction}}

For a new \(x\) value, \[y = a + bx\] is the \textbf{predicted} value of
\(y\). That is, if we have an \(x\) value, we can plug it into the
equation and find out what value of \(y\) we would expect.

Note: There is still variance around this prediction! Our ``expected''
value will never be exactly equal to the truth - The value of \(y\) at a
given value of \(x\) follows a normal distribution\footnote{Our
  \textbf{prediction} is just us guessing the mean value of \(y\) at
  different values of \(x\).}, and the probability of a single point is
0!

\hypertarget{extrapolation}{%
\section{Extrapolation}\label{extrapolation}}

\textbf{Extrapolation} is what happens when prediction goes wrong. In
particular, it's what happens when we try to make a prediction at an
\(x\) value where we don't have any data. Usually this means we're
predicting an \(x\) value far above or far below the range of our data,
but it can also happen if there's a gap in the middle of our data.

In the plot below, the black dots are the original data, and we're
trying to predict a new value at \(x = 25\). The red line is the true
model that I generated the data from. The black line represents a linear
model. This model fits the original data quite well\footnote{Even though
  it's not the true relationship, it's a reasonable approximation.}, but
predictions are completely inappropriate for values outside the data.

\hypertarget{lurking-variables}{%
\section{Lurking Variables}\label{lurking-variables}}

The black line in the plot below represents a regression where all of
the data was lumped together. As we can see, this line does not seem to
fit the data well. There is a hidden relationship in the the data - the
green points and the red points should be considered
separately\footnote{Possibly as a blocking variable.}.

\includegraphics{L04-Regression_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-10-1.pdf}

A more serious consequence of a lurking variable has shown up before in
the Palmer penguins data. In that example, the lurking variable actually
\textbf{reversed} the correlation - if we lumped the groups together we
got a negative correlation (and therefore negative slope), but if we
looked at the groups individually we got positive associations in all of
the groups! This is called \textbf{Simpson's Paradox}, and basically
means that we have to be very careful about interpreting correlations!

\hypertarget{defining-probability-with-dice}{%
\chapter{Defining Probability with
Dice}\label{defining-probability-with-dice}}

I find that the easiest way is to build this up by examples. Let's start
with rolling a dice.\footnote{The singular form ``die'' is dieing out;
  the dictionary lists ``dice'' as singular noun, and the singular
  ``dice'' is clearer for new English speakers.} Let's say you rolled
the dice, and you got a 3. This is called a \textbf{simple event}. The
collection of all \textbf{simple events} is called the \textbf{Sample
Space}, which in this case is \(\mathcal S\)=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}.

Now, suppose that you're about to roll a dice. You might be curious
about whether it's a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or a 6, but you might only care
about the \textbf{event} that the outcome is even. Since there are
multiple simple events that make up this event, it is called a
\textbf{compound event}.

There's no way for you to know what's going to happen, but you know all
of the possibilities and you know how likely they all are.\footnote{Assuming
  there's nothing unusual about your dice.} This is called a
\textbf{Probability Model}: The sample space along with the probability
of all of the events.

I said ``the probability of all events'', but this is more complicated
than it may seem and requires some explanation. For something like
rolling a dice, you only need to know the probability of each simple
event. Compound events, like the probability that the outcome is even,
can be determined from these simple events.

Suppose you're playing a game where, if the outcome of the dice is less
than a certain cutoff value you get to roll again (e.g., your character
has a special ability that allows re-rolling of dice, but the re-roll
condition depends on the situation). You know the probability of all of
the simple events, but you need to know the cutoff value to actually
compute any probabilities. Without the cutoff value, you cannot define
the probability model.

For a dice, the probability model is simply: Each number has a
probability of 1 in 6. But what does this mean? There are two
perspectives on what a ``probability'' is: The Frequentist approach and
the Bayesian approach. In this class we're only going to learn the
Frequentist definition of probability, but if you're interested in
learning more I'm happy to talk.\footnote{Most of my work uses the
  Bayesian definition.}

\textbf{Probability} (Frequentist Definition): The long run frequency of
observing an event. In other words, it's the number of times an event is
observed divided by the number of trials after doing a near-infinite
number of trials.

For the dice, if we rolled the dice 60 times, we would expect 10 of
those rolls to be a 1, 10 of them to be a 2, etc. Due to randomness, we
won't get exactly that, but this is what we would expect. If we rolled
600 dice, we would expect 100 to be 1, etc. As we roll more dice, we get
closer to the proportion of 1/6. The plot below this demonstrates this -
it is the number of times that a dice was 1 divided by the number of
trials, with the number of trials being increased. Notice how it takes a
while for the ``empirical'' probability to reach the theoretical
probably; as the number of trials approaches infinity, the proportion of
rolls that showed a 1 will approach 1/6.

\includegraphics{L05-Probability_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{calculating-probability-with-dice}{%
\chapter{Calculating Probability with
Dice}\label{calculating-probability-with-dice}}

First, let's introduce some notation. I will use P(x) to mean ``The
probability of x''. In some cases, the context will be clear, such as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``The probability of rolling a 1'' = P(1)
\item
  ``The probability of rolling an even number'' = P(even)
\item
  ``The probability of \emph{not} rolling a 1'' = 1 - P(1)\footnote{This
    is called a \textbf{complement}.}
\end{itemize}

For this section, we'll assume that
P(1)=P(2)=P(3)=P(4)=P(5)=P(6)=1/6.\footnote{The sum of all probabilities
  must be 1.}

\hypertarget{or}{%
\section{``Or''}\label{or}}

What's the probability that we roll an even number? The even numbers are
2, 4, and 6, so what we're really asking is ``What's the probability
that we roll a 2, 4, \textbf{or} a 6?'' In this case, the probability is
P(2 or 4 or 6) = P(2)+P(4)+P(6) = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 0.5.

We also could have figured out this probability by noting that half of
the values are even, so a probability of 0.5 makes sense. It's a good
thing when our intuition matches our answer, as we'll see next.

Let's consider the probability that the dice is even\^{} (which we will
denote P(even)) \textbf{or} it's strictly larger than 3 (denoted
P(\textgreater3)). This means the dice is either 2, 4, or 6, or it's 4,
5, 6. Since there are 4 different numbers (2, 4, 5, and 6) that would
match the criteria, the probability is 4/6. Let's use our ``or'' rules
to verify this!

The probability that the dice is even is 1/2. The probabilty that the
dice is larger than 3 is also 1/2. So, obviously, P(even or
\textgreater3) = P(even) + P(\textgreater3) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.

Wait.

That can't be right.

I think you may be able to see what went wrong. The P(even) = P(2) +
P(4) + P(6), and P(\textgreater3) = P(4) + P(5) + P(6). When we did
P(even) + P(\textgreater3), we added P(4) and P(6) twice! To get the
right answer, we need to fix this. Since we added them twice, we must
subtract them once. This brings us to\ldots{}

\hypertarget{the-addition-rule-for-or}{%
\section{The Addition Rule for ``or''}\label{the-addition-rule-for-or}}

For any two events A and B,\footnote{For example, A = ``Even'', B =
  ``\textgreater3''.} the \textbf{Addition Rule} states:

\begin{align}P(A\; or\; B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\; and\; B).\end{align}

First, note that the probability of both events is P(Even \textbf{and}
\textgreater3) = P(4) + P(6), since 4 and 6 are both even and larger
than 3.

\begin{align*}
 P(Even\; or\; >3) & = P(Even) + P(>3) - P(Even\; and\; >3)\\
& = [P(2) + P(4) + P(6)] + [P(4) + P(5) + P(6)] - [P(4) + P(6)]\\
& =  P(2) + P(4) + P(5) + P(6)\\
& = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6\\
& = 4/6
\end{align*} \normalsize

\hypertarget{and-part-1}{%
\section{``and'': Part 1}\label{and-part-1}}

The word ``and'' came up in the addition rule, and so I should give a
good definition of ``and''. When we talk about events A and B, P(A and
B) refers to the probability that they both happen together. It's most
helpful to see this as a Venn diagram:

\includegraphics{figs/Venn1.png}

P(A) is the area of the circle labelled A, P(B) is the area of the
circle labelled B, and P(A and B) is the area of the overlap between
these two circles. P(A or B) is the total shaded area, including the
yellow-green, green, and dark green.

You can see the Addition Rule at work here. If you add the area of A
(which includes P(A and B)) to the area of B (which also includes P(A
and B)), you've added P(A and B) twice!

There are two formulas for P(A and B). The first one is found by
rearranging the formula for P(A or B):

\begin{align*}
\small P(A\; or\; B) &\small = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \;and\; B)\\
\small P(A\; and\; B) &\small = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \;or\; B)
\end{align*}

When in doubt, just remember P(A\_B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\_B), then put
``or'' in one blank and ``and'' in the other.

This formula won't always get you to the solution, though. There will be
many times where neither ``and'' nor ``or'' will be obvious, and we'll
need to do some more work to get them. We have special formulas for
``and'', so we'll usually try to figure out the ``and'' and then use it
to figure out the ``or''\footnote{This lecture has some of the weirdest
  sentences.}.

\hypertarget{given-conditional-probabilities}{%
\section{``given'': Conditional
Probabilities}\label{given-conditional-probabilities}}

A \emph{condition} is something that must happen before you can proceed.
A \textbf{conditional probability} is a probability that requires
something else to happen, and usually involves a more complicated setup.

Let's look at another scenario. Let's say I told you that the number on
the dice was larger than 3. What's the probability that the number on
the dice is a 4? Intuiutively, it's 1/3, since there are 3 possible
numbers. Our notation fails us here, P(4) denotes the probability that
the dice is a 4, which we already determined was 1/6. We can't use P(4)
for two things, so we need to add some notation.

In this case, the solution is to use a vertical bar, ``\textbar{}'',
which is pronounced ``given''. We write ``P(dice is 4 \textbar{} dice is
greater than 3) = 1/3'',\footnote{P(4 \textbar{} \textgreater3) just
  looks too confusing, so I added some words.} which is read as ``The
probability that the dice is 4, \textbf{given that} the dice is larger
than 3.''

A very important thing happened here: when we used a conditional
probability (``given that''), we \textbf{restricted the sample space}.
When we ``condition'' on an event, it means that we're only looking at
cases where that event happened. ``The probability that the dice is 4,
given that the dice is larger than 3'' is another way of saying that
we're only considering events where the dice roll is greater than 3; we
don't care about 1, 2, or 3.

We defined ``probability'' as the total number of events divided by the
total number of trials. For conditional probabilities, this means that
we're only looking at \emph{some of} the trials.

\begin{align*}
\small P(dice\; is\; 4\; |\; dice\; is >3) = \frac{\#\; ways\;dice\;can\;be\;4\;}{\#\;ways\;dice\;can\;be\;>3}=\frac{1}{3}
\end{align*}

\textbf{This formula is incorrect}: ``The number of ways that a dice can
be 4'' depends on the condition. For instance, the number of ways that a
dice can be 2 is 0 since we're told it's larger than 3. We are actually
looking at the number of ways that the dice can be both 4 \textbf{and}
greater than 3. Let's incorporate this information:

\begin{align*}
\small P(dice\; is\; 4\; |\; dice\; is >3) = \frac{\#\; ways\;dice\;can\;be\;4\;\;and\;>3}{\#\;ways\;dice\;can\;be\;>3}=\frac{1}{3}
\end{align*}

For any two events A and B, \textbf{conditional probabilities} are
defined as follows:\footnote{To remember this, I like to imagine the
  vertical bar falling on the the B and pushing it into the denominator.}

\begin{align*}
\small P(A | B) = \frac{P(A\;and\; B)}{P(B)}
\end{align*}

The equation above is a \emph{definition}. It's not the result of
something else, it's the way we define conditional probability.
Rearranging it, though, gives us an important result.

For any two events A and B, the \textbf{Multiplication Rule} states:

\begin{align*}
\small P(A\; and\; B) = P(A|B)P(B)
\end{align*}

Note that P(B\textbar A) = P(A and B)/P(A), so the multiplication rule
can be extended:

\begin{align*}
\small P(A\; and\; B) &\small = P(A|B)P(B)\\
\small P(A\; and\; B) &\small = P(B|A)P(A)
\end{align*}

In other words, you can write it either way as long as the event that
comes after the ``\textbar{}'' also appears on it's own.

Let's use this to answer the following question: What's the probability
that a dice is larger than 3 \textbf{and} even? By intuition, this
should be 2/6 since there are two cases where both are true, but let's
verify with math!

First, recall that P(\textgreater3) and P(even) are both 1/2.

P(\textgreater3 \textbar{} even) means that we're look at the number of
dice rolls that are larger than 3, but we're only considering even dice
rolls. We have 3 total dice rolls that are even, and 2 of those are
larger than 3, so this probability is 2/3. Using the multiplication
rule, P(\textgreater3 and even) = P(\textgreater3 \textbar{}
even)*P(even) = (2/3)*(1/2) = 2/6, which is what we got before!

The other way works out the same. Given that the roll is larger than 3,
there are 2 even rolls, which means that P(even \textbar{}
\textgreater3) = 2/3. P(\textgreater3 and even) = P(even \textbar{}
\textgreater3)*P(even) = (2/3)*(1/2) = 2/6, which is what we got before!

\hypertarget{disjoint-a.k.a.-mutually-exclusive}{%
\subsection{Disjoint, a.k.a. Mutually
Exclusive}\label{disjoint-a.k.a.-mutually-exclusive}}

\textbf{Disjoint} events, also called \textbf{mutually exclusive}
events, are events that \emph{cannot} occur together. For example, the
event that you roll a 4 and it's also a 3. This simply does not work, so
the probability is 0.

More formally, A and B are \textbf{disjoint} if P(A and B) = 0.

\hypertarget{the-addition-rule-for-disjoint-events}{%
\subsection{The Addition Rule for Disjoint
Events}\label{the-addition-rule-for-disjoint-events}}

If A and B are disjoint, then P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B).\footnote{Not an
  important point: This is a rule, not a result. The General Addition
  Rule is a result of this rule, not the other way around.}

This is actually why we were able to say P(even) = P(2 or 4 or 6) = P(2)
+ P(4) + P(6) = 3/6: the events ``2'', ``4'', and ``6'' are disjoint.

\hypertarget{independent}{%
\subsection{Independent}\label{independent}}

Two events are \textbf{independent} if the knowledge of one event tells
you nothing about the other.\footnote{The opposite of
  \textbf{independence} is \textbf{dependence}.} For instance, if I flip
two different coins and tell you that the first one was Heads, you still
only have a 50/50 chance of guessing the second one.

Notice the phrasing in the previous sentence: ``If I tell you that the
first one is heads\ldots{}'' That is, I'm \emph{restricting the sample
space}. Independence is all about conditional probabilities!

Formally, A and B are independent if P(A \textbar{} B) = P(A).

This adds further insight into conditional probabilities: P(A\textbar B)
is how likely A is, given that you know B happened. Knowledge of B
changes your guess of the likelihood of A. If it doesn't change your
guess, then they are independent.\footnote{Just like in correlations,
  dependence does \emph{not} imply causation!}

The following app demonstrates this concept:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{shiny}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{runGitHub}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{repo =} \StringTok{"DBecker7/DB7\_TeachingApps"}\NormalTok{, }
    \AttributeTok{subdir =} \StringTok{"Apps/indep"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Another lesson to take from the app above: Independence doesn't look
special. You can't just tell that things are independent by looking at
them.

\hypertarget{the-multiplication-rule-for-independent-events}{%
\subsection{The Multiplication Rule for Independent
Events}\label{the-multiplication-rule-for-independent-events}}

Any time I see a conditional probability, I immediately write down the
formula. For dependence, we are saying:

P(A\textbar B) = P(A and B)/P(B)

which is the same as

P(A and B) = P(A\textbar B)P(B)\footnote{This equation is \emph{always}
  true.}

If two events are \textbf{independent}, then P(A\textbar B)=P(A),
therefore:

P(A and B) \(\stackrel{indep}{=}\) P(A)*P(B)\footnote{The ``\(indep\)''
  over the equals sign is there to specify that this is only true if
  events are independent.}

Get this tattood backwards on your forehead so you see it every time you
look at yourself in the mirror: \textbf{P(A and B) is ONLY equal to
P(A)*P(B) when A and B are independent!!!} Some textbooks start with
this rule then move to the general rule, but far too many students start
using P(A and B) = P(A)P(B) as if it's always true. My entire thesis is
based on whether you can say two things are independent, so it's kind of
a sore spot for me. DO NOT MIX THIS UP.

For example, are the events ``even'' and ``\textgreater3'' independent?
If you know that the dice roll is \textgreater3, then there's a 2/3
chance that it's even. That is, P(even\textbar\textgreater3) = 2/3
\(\ne\) 1/2 = P(even), so it's not independent.

Alternatively, we can calcuate P(even and \textgreater3) = 2/3, but
P(even)*P(\textgreater3) = (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4. Since 2/3 \(\ne\) 1/4,
these events are not independent.

\hypertarget{disjoint-means-dependent}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Disjoint means
\emph{Dependent}}{Disjoint means Dependent}}\label{disjoint-means-dependent}}

\textbf{Independence} can be defined as ``if you know that one event
happened, you have no knowledge of the other event.'' \textbf{Disjoint}
can be defined as ``if you know one event happened, you know for sure
that the other one \emph{did not} happen.'' If two events are disjoint,
they must be \textbf{dependent}. In fact, knowledge of one event means
that you for sure know about the other - the exact opposite of
independence!

\ldots{} except when one event is impossible. For instance, P(even and
7) = 0 since there are no dice rolls that are both even and 7, but this
is also equal to P(even)*P(7) = 0 since there are no dice rolls that are
7.

Question 10.6 from the textbook:\footnote{Baldi, B. and DS. Moore. 2018.
  \emph{The Practice of Statistics in the Life Sciences.} 4th Edition,
  W.H. Freeman and Company.}

The National Survey on Drug Use and Health reports that 18.1\% of all
adults in the United States had a mental illness in 2014. Among adults
with a substance use disorder, 39.1\% had a mental illness. By
comparison, only 16.2\% of adults without a substance use disorder had a
mental illness. The report also states that 3.3\% of American adults had
both a mental illness and a substance use disorder. Use the notation MI
and SUD for mental illness and substance abuse disorder, respectively.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Express the four percents cited here as probabilities for a randomly
  selected American adult. Use proper probability notation.
\item
  Obtain the probability P(SUD\textbar MI). Write a sentence reporting
  this probability in context.
\end{enumerate}

Solutions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  There are a couple of probabilities:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ``18.1\% of all adults in the United States had a mental illness'':
    P(MI) = 18.1
  \item
    ``Among adults with a substance use disorder, 39.1\% had a mental
    illness.'' The part that says ``among adults with SUD'' means that
    we're only looking at people with SUD; we're \emph{restricting the
    sample space}. This is a condition, so our answer must be P(\_
    \textbar{} SUD) = \_\_. The blanks can be filled in as
    P(MI\textbar SUD) = 0.391.
  \item
    ``16.2\% of adults without a substance use disorder had a mental
    illness.'' The part that says ``adults without a SUD'' is also
    \emph{restricting the sample space}, so our probability statement
    will be P(\_\_ \textbar{} no SUD) = \_\_. The blanks are filled in
    as P(MI \textbar{} no SUD) = 0.162.\footnote{This is a great place
      to mention: There's absolutely no reason why P(A\textbar B) +
      P(A\textbar{} not B) should add to 1.}
  \item
    ``3.3\% of American adults had both a MI and a SUD''. This clearly
    states \textbf{and}, so we are looking at P(MI and SUD) = 0.033
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Part b. is going to take a few steps. Let's write down all the formulas
that might help. Firstly. there's no ``or'', so that probably won't do
it.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Want}: P(SUD\textbar MI)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    P(SUD\textbar MI) = P(SUD and MI)/P(MI), so we need P(SUD and MI)
    and P(MI).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Have}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    P(MI) = 0.181
  \item
    P(MI \textbar{} SUD) = 0.391
  \item
    P(MI \textbar{} no SUD) = 0.162
  \item
    P(MI and SUD) = 0.033
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Both P(SUD and MI) and P(MI) are given in the question, so our answer is
simply:

\begin{quote}
P(SUD \textbar{} MI) = P(SUD and MI)/P(MI) = 0.033/0.181 = 0.1823
\end{quote}

Therefore 18.23\% of people with mental illness have substance abuse
disorder.

Compare this value to P(MI \textbar{} SUD) = 0.391. In general, there is
no easy relationship between P(A \textbar{} B) and P(B \textbar{} A). If
you know what P(A \textbar{} B) is, you can't really guess at what P(B
\textbar{} A) is; you need a lot more information!

\hypertarget{two-way-tables}{%
\chapter{Two-Way Tables}\label{two-way-tables}}

I rigorously collected the following data\footnote{Source: I made it up.}
on programming language usage for different disciplines using the most
appropriate sampling methods.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lllll@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
& Stats & Math & Comp Sci & Total \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
R & 90 & 30 & 40 & 160 \\
Python & 10 & 60 & 100 & 170 \\
MatLab & 15 & 60 & 15 & 90 \\
Julia & 10 & 10 & 1 & 21 \\
\textbf{Total} & 125 & 160 & 156 & 431 \\
\end{longtable}

From this table, we can calculate \textbf{marginal} and
\textbf{conditional} probabilities.

\textbf{Marginal} probabilities are calculated from the margins, which
means that we ignore one of the variables. For example, P(Math) =
160/431 and P(Julia) = 21/431. Both of these proportions are based on
the margins - they don't take the other variable into account.

\textbf{Conditional} probabilities are the same idea as we saw earlier.
Again, we are \emph{restricting our sample space} by conditioning on
another variable. For example, P(R \textbar{} Stats) = 90/125, whereas
P(Stats \textbar{} R) = 90/160. The conditioning event determines which
row/column we use. When we condition on Stats, we \emph{only} look at
the column labelled stats - we do not consider any of the other numbers.
This is why P(R \textbar{} Stats) has a numerator of 125, rather than
431.

You should be familiar with the following calculations:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  P(Stats) = 125/431
\item
  P(Stats \textbar{} Julia) = 10/21
\item
  P(Matlab \textbar{} Comp Sci) = ???\footnote{Answer is at the end.}
\item
  P(Stats \textbf{and} Julia) = 10/431
\item
  P(Matlab \textbf{and} Stats) = 15/431
\item
  P(Stats \textbf{or} Julia) = P(Stats) + P(Julia) - P(Stats
  \textbf{and} Julia) = 136/431
\item
  P(Matlab \textbf{or} Stats) = 200
\item
  P(Stats \textbf{or} R) = ???
\item
  P(Stats \textbf{or} Math) = ??
\end{enumerate}

1)}\label{the-normal-distributions-part-1}}

\hypertarget{introduction-2}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction-2}}

In this lecture we are looking at continuous distributions. Continuous
distributions have an odd quirk. If a variable has a continuous
distribution, then \(P(X = x) = 0\). That is, the probability of any
specific value is infinitely small.

Think of it this way: suppose that human heights go from 54 cm to 272
cm. For now, suppose all of these heights are equally likely. If we
record heights to the nearest centimeter, there are 219 possible
heights, so the probability that you are one of those heights is 1/219.
If we round to the nearest mm, there are 21,900 different heights. As we
get a more and more accurate measuring instrument, the probability of
any given height goes to 0. It's not that these heights are impossible,
it's that you're probably not going to ever guess my exact height when
we measure it with infinite accuracy.

So what do we do? How could we possibly calculate probabilities? Well,
we measure ranges! You can't guess my height exactly, but we can talk
about the probability that my height is between 170 and 180 cm, or even
the probability that my height would be 170, assuming we round to the
nearest centimeter.

\hypertarget{some-facts-about-distributions}{%
\section{Some Facts about
Distributions}\label{some-facts-about-distributions}}

Before we begin, the following properties are true of \emph{any}
distribution, regardless of whether they are discrete or continuous.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  All probabilities must be between 0 and 1.
\item
  All probabilities together must make 1.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For discrete, adding them all should get you to 1.
  \item
    For continuous, the area under the density curve must be
    1.\footnote{This is done with integrals, but we won't actually do
      this in this course.}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If two events are disjoint, you must be able to add their
  probabilities.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It's weird, but we have to define this as a rule first before we can
    calculate probabilities.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The first point should be obvious, and you won't ever need to check
whether the third point is true.

The second point is the important one: The total probability for all
events must be 1. For continuous distributions like the normal
distribution, that means that the area under the curve is 1.\footnote{For
  continuous distributions, ``probability'' and ``area under the curve''
  are synonyms.}

\hypertarget{the-normal-distribution}{%
\chapter{The Normal Distribution}\label{the-normal-distribution}}

The normal distribution is a way to define the probability of something
using a function, but the function is complicated.\footnote{\((2\pi\sigma^2)^{-1/2}\exp\left(\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{-2\sigma^2}\right)\)}
Instead, we'll jump right into how to use it and let software deal with
the function.

In the introduction, I used the example of people's heights. I made the
assumption that all heights were equally likely, but this is just a
bonkers thing to say. Instead, some heights are more likely than other
heights. Of course, this doesn't mean that, say, 170 cm is very
unlikely, but 175 is likely, then 176 is unlikely, then 177 is
\emph{very} unlikely, then 178 is suddenly really likely again; most
people have heights close to the average and heights further from the
average are less likely. This is exactly what the normal distribution is
for! Here's what the normal distribution looks like:

\end{figure}

The plot above has the highest point occurs at exactly 162.3, which is
the best number I could find for the actual average height of Canadian
women. This is denoted \(\mu\). The width of the curve is a little
trickier - how did I choose to make it go from 145 to 180? I could
easily have stretched it out or squeezed it inwards in both directions.
The width is defined by the standard deviation, which is denoted
\(\sigma\). Because of the way the normal distribution is defined,
there's nothing else we can change about it - knowing \(\mu\) and
\(\sigma\) are enough to draw the entire curve.

If we have a variable \(X\) that follows a normal distribution, we use
the notation \(X \sim N(\mu, \sigma)\).

Some textbooks use the notation \(X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)\), i.e.~they
use \(\sigma^2\) rather than \(\sigma\). It's like driving on the left
or the right side of the road - both are fine, but we have to choose one
and stick with it.

\end{tcolorbox}

The idea that ``most things are close to the center, and fewer things
further away'' can be very powerful. This applies to:

    happen.

1}\label{calculating-normal-probabilities---part-1}}

The height and width of the normal distribution are determined by the
\textbf{mean} (\(\mu\)) and \textbf{standard deviation} (\(\sigma\)),
and \emph{only} the mean and standard deviation. The mean just moves the
curve left and right, the standard deviation squeezes or stretches it.

To highlight this, we introduce something called the \textbf{Empirical
Rule}, a.k.a. the 68-95-99.5 Rule. No matter what the mean of the
distribution is, 68\% of the probability is within 1 standard deviation
of the mean. To say this another way, let's extend our notation
slightly. If \(X\sim N(\mu,\sigma)\), we can say that:

\begin{align*}
P(\mu - \sigma \le X \le \mu + \sigma) \approx 0.68
\end{align*}

To phrase this in another way, if we were to draw random numbers from
the normal distribution, 68\% of them would be between 1sd below the
mean and 1sd above the mean.

(67.66\%) of them were above -1 but below 1. If we change the mean and

Some variant of the following image appears in countless textbooks:

\includegraphics{figs/emprirical.png}

As a small side note, the image above uses the word ``data''. By this,
it means that if this is the \textbf{population}, then 68\% of all the
data that it were possible to collect would be within one standard
deviation of the mean. As we saw in the simulated data above, this
number is almost never going to be perfect.

\hypertarget{trickier-calculations}{%
\section{Trickier calculations}\label{trickier-calculations}}

If 68\% of the data is between \(\mu - \sigma\) and \(\mu + \sigma\),
then there's still 32\% of the distribution outside this range. The
normal distribution is \textbf{symmetric}, so this 32\% gets split
exactly in half and 16\% of the distribution is below \(\mu - \sigma\),
and 16\% is above \(\mu + \sigma\).

Based on this calculation, we can say that 84\% of any normal
distribution is below \(\mu + \sigma\), and 84\% is above
\(\mu - \sigma\). Before we move on, draw out some normal distributions
to convince yourself that 97.5\% of any normal distribution is less than
\(\mu + 2\sigma\).\footnote{I generally keep a running tally of the
  number of normal distributions I draw on the board. Last time I did
  this, I was almost at 100. The moral: you should be drawing a lot of
  normal distributions!!!}

You should try the following calculations yourself, all of which can be
done with basic arithmetic and the 68-95-99.7 Rule:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Below \(\mu+2\sigma\) and above \(\mu-\sigma\).
\item
  Below \(\mu+2\sigma\) and above \(\mu+\sigma\).
\item
  Above \(\mu + 2\sigma\) and below \(\mu + 3\sigma\)
\item
  Above \(\mu - 3\sigma\) and below 0.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{the-standard-normal-distribution}{%
\chapter{The Standard Normal
Distribution}\label{the-standard-normal-distribution}}

We use a special letter (Z, pronounced ``zed'' because we're Canadian)
to denote a standard normal distribution. In particular,
\(Z\sim N(0, 1)\) is a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard
deviation 1. Many many many many textbooks have a table in the back of
them that gives probabilities for the standard normal distribution, and
they call them \(Z\) tables.

All normal distributions have the exact same shape. In order to change
the mean and sd, we can simply re-write the numbers on the axes. If we
want to shift the whole curve to the left by 2 units, we can re-label
the numbers on the x axis. If we change the sd, the plot might get
``taller'' or ``shorter'', but if we zoom in on the plot we can make it
look exactly the same!\footnote{This is also the reason why the
  empirical rule works! If you change the labels on the plot,
  \(\mu+\sigma\) stays in the same place so you can calculate the same
  probability.}

\hypertarget{standardizing-a-normal-distribution}{%
\section{Standardizing a Normal
Distribution}\label{standardizing-a-normal-distribution}}

Because they all look the same, we might as well work with just one of
them! Suppose \(X\sim N(\mu,\sigma)\). If we shift the whole curve to
the left, then the mean shifts as well and the mean is 0. In other
words, \(X-\mu \sim N(0,\sigma)\). Now that the mean is at 0,
\(\mu + 1\sigma\) is simply \(\sigma\), \(\mu-3\sigma\) is \(-3\sigma\),
and so on. If we divide all of the numbers by \(\sigma\), then
\(\sigma\) is simply 1, \(-3\sigma\) is simply -3, and so on. To
formalize this, if \(x\sim N(\mu,\sigma)\), then

\begin{align*}
\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma} = Z \sim N(0, 1)
\end{align*}

This is called \textbf{standardizing} a normal distribution. The
resultant value is called the \textbf{z-score}.

For example, suppose a woman is 155.19 cm tall. If the true mean height
of Canadian women is 162.3 and the standard deviation is 7.11, then this
particular woman is exactly one standard deviation \emph{below} the
mean. This is the \textbf{z-score}, a.k.a. the standardized value; this
woman's z-score is -1.

Now consider a woman who is 161.22 cm tall. Her z-score would be
-0.152,\footnote{The negative is important!} meaning that she is 0.152
standard deviations below the mean.

Let's return to the 155.19 cm tall woman. If you take a woman at random
from the population, what is the probability that the randomly chosen
woman be be shorter than 155.19 cm? Based on the 68-95-99.7 rule, 68\%
of women are within one standard deviation of the mean, which is a range
from 155.19 to 169.41. Since 68\% of the women are betwen these two
numbers, 16\% of them are shorter than 155.19 (it is also true that 16\%
are taller than 169.41, but this was not required for the question).

Now, what's the probability that a randomly chosen woman is, say,
shorter than 160 cm? This doesn't fit nicely in the empirical rule, so
we need another way to calculate probabilities. However, it's worth
stopping and trying to make a guess! The empirical rule tells us that
16\% of women are below 155.19 cm, and we also know that 50\% of women
are shorter than the average of 162.3 cm (since the normal distribution
is symmetric), so we expect that the answer is somewhere between 16\%
and 50\%, probably closer to 50\% since 160 cm is closer to 162.3 cm
than it is to 155.19 cm.

\hypertarget{calculating-normal-probabilities---part-2}{%
\chapter{Calculating Normal Probabilities - Part
2}\label{calculating-normal-probabilities---part-2}}

In general, we use the \textbf{cumulative distribution function} (CDF,
or cdf) to calculate probabilities. As with the cumulative probability
tables we saw in the probability lectures, the cumulative probability
calculates the area to the \emph{left} of a particular point.\footnote{Recall
  that \(P(X=x) = 0\) in continuous distributions, so we look at ranges.}
Questions about the normal distribution generally come in three
flavours:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Find \(P(X \le a)\)
\item
  Find \(P(X \ge b)\)
\item
  Find \(P(c \le X\le d)\)
\end{enumerate}

The \textbf{cdf} is defined as \(P(X\le x)\), which allows us to answer
questions like 1. For the standard normal distribution, a table of Z
probabilities can be found at the back of the textbook. I've added a
file that demonstrates how to use the Z-table in the Lecture Materials.
This is something that is crucial to know for closed-book tests since
you will need to caclulate probabilities somehow, but we can't let you
have a computer to run R! Before moving on, read ``\textbf{Intro to
Ztable.pdf}''.

In that file, there are some practice problems. Below, you'll find a
selection of solutions using R. For your own practice, try and calculate
them with the Z-table (with some good drawings) and verify your answer
with R.

For questions like \(P(X\ge x)\), we can simply use the fact that
\(P(X \ge x) = 1 - P(X<x)\). Since this is a continuous distribution and
\(P(X = x)=0\), we also know that \(P(X\le x) = P(X<x)\) and we can just
use the cdf. The last one is a little bit trickier.

To calculate the probability that a randomly chosen value will be within
a given range, there are a few steps. Let's use the same example as the
textbook: If \(X\sim N(-2, 1)\) find \(P(-2.5\le X\le -1)\). If we want
to use the cdf, we need to re-write this in terms of \(P(X\le x)\).

Here's how we do it. If we only find \(P(X\le-1)\), then we have taken
too much of the distribution. Everything to the left of -2.5 was
something that should not have been included. So why don't we just
remove it? By this logic, we find
\(P(-2.5\le X \le -1) = P(X\le -1) - P(X \le -2.5)\). This is shown
graphically below:

\includegraphics{figs/addgraphs.png}

Returning to the heights example, the probability of a randomly chosen
woman being less than 160 cm can be calculated as: \[
\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{160 - 162.3}{7.11} = -0.323488045
\] We can now look up -0.323 on the normal table. Try that out, and
verify that you get the same value here:

  If X has a mean of 4 and a sd of 2, what's the probability of a value
  less than 0?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Solution 1}: Standardize and Z-table. I'll split this up
    into steps:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Standardize: \((x-\mu)/\sigma = (0 - 4)/2 = -2\).
    \item
      Find -2 on the Z table: -2=-2.00, so this will be in the row
      labelled -2.0 and the column labelled 0.00,\footnote{The rows are
        the digits before and after the decimal, the column is the
        second digit after the decimal.} which is 0.0228.
    \item
      Conclude: 2.28\% of the N(4,2) distribution is below 0.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    \textbf{Solution 2}: Empircal rule.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Before calculating a normal probability, try and estimate how many
      standard deviations away from the mean the value is. In this case,
      0 is 2 standard deviations from 4. The 68-95-99.7 rule states that
      95\% of the distribution is outside the range from
      \(\mu - 2\sigma\) to \(\mu + 2\sigma\), so 5\% is outside of this
      range. This means that 2.5\% is on either side, which means that
      2.5\% is below 0.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

A short version of Solution 2: By the 68-95-99.7 Rule, 95\% is between 0
and 8. Therefore, 2.5\% must be less than 0.

As you can see, the 68-95-99.7 rule is \emph{approximate}. However, I
highly recommend doing many practice problems with it. On a multiple
choice question, if you can figure out the answer with the Empirical
Rule than you might be able to guess the correct answer much quicker.
You won't get the exact answer, but if there's only one answer that's
close to your guess, then that's probably it.\footnote{You need to trust
  your ability to use the Empirical Rule, though.}

  If \(X\sim N(1234, 56)\), what's the probability of a number smaller
  than 1432.
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Before we begin:} What do we expect the number to be? The mean is
1234, which is smaller than 1432. Is it a little smaller, or is it a lot
smaller? Compared to the standard deviation, it's a lot smaller. By the
empirical rule, the vast majority of the distribution is below
\(\mu + 3\sigma\), which is approximately 1400.\footnote{Quick maths -
  we're just trying to get an okay guess, not the exact answer right
  now.} We should expect an answer close to 1, since the area under the
normal distribution is 1.

\textbf{Solution 1}: \((x-\mu)/\sigma = (1432-1234)/56 = 3.54\), which
is not on the Z table. When this happens (and we don't have access to
technology), we simply say the answer is 1.\footnote{If the z-score were
  -3.54, we'd say the probability is 0.}

\textbf{Solution 2}: The value we're interested in isn't 1, 2, or 3
standard deviations from the mean, so the Empirical Rule doesn't apply.
However, we can guess that our probability will be close to 1 since it's
larger than 3 standard deviations away.

  \(X \sim N(2,3)\), find \(P(-1 < X < 5)\)
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Before we begin:} This is the empirical rule for 1sd. The answer
is 68\%.

\emph{With a Z table}: We calculate the z-score individually, then
subtract the probabilities in a way that makes sense.\footnote{P(X
  \textless{} 5) - P(X \textless{} -1)}
\(P(X < -1) = P((X-\mu)/\sigma < (-1 - \mu)/\sigma) = P(Z < (-1 - 2)/3) = P(Z < -1) = 0.1587\).
Similarly, \(P(X < 5) = P(Z < 1) = 0.8413\). The answer is 0.8413 -
0.1587 = 0.6826, which is very close to what we got with the Empirical
Rule.

\emph{With R}:

What's the first quartile of an N(2,3) distribution? It's the point at
which 25\% of the distribution is smaller. In other words, P(X
\textless{} Q1) = 0.25. How do we find Q1?

We can look up 0.25 as a probability. That is, as a value in the
\emph{body} of the Z table. This will give us the corresponding
z-score.\footnote{Recall: the body of the Z table are probabilities, the
  margins are z-scores.} Unfortunately, 0.25 isn't in the table. The
closest values are 0.2514 (which is a Z score of -0.67) and 0.2483 (Z
score of -0.68). On a test situation, -0.67 and -0.68 would both be
valid answers, as would -0.675.

In R, the ``\texttt{q}'' family of functions are the reverse lookup
functions. That is, You tell them the probability, and they return the
z-score.

However, we're not done yet! We found the quartile for a \emph{standard
normal} distribution. We have to go backwards in the standardization
formula. In essence, we have found Z and we need to find X.

\begin{align*}
\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = z \Leftrightarrow x = z\sigma + \mu
\end{align*}

To finish this question, we say that the first quartile of a N(2, 3)
distribution is -0.67*3 + 2 = -0.01.\footnote{-0.68*3 + 2 and -0.675*3 +
  2 would also be acceptable.}

  For each of the probability statements, draw the normal distribution
  and add shading for the probability. For example, P(Z \textgreater{}
  1) should be a normal distribution with everything under the curve and
  larger than 1 shaded in. This is a very good way to help internalize
  the fact that all probabilities are areas.
\item
  In P(Z \textless{} 1.32) = 0.9066, what do 1.32 and 0.9066 represent?

If you have not calculated at least 50 or 60 different normal
probabilities by the midterm, you have probably not done enough
practice.

For each of these questions, start by trying to use the empirical rule,
then use the Z table, then confirm your answer with R. Answers with R
are shown below, but you should only check these once you're confident
with your own answer.\footnote{Pre-emptively checking the answer
  destroys any chance of learning and creates a false sense of
  knowledge.}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(X \sim N(0,2)\), what percent of the distribution is above 1?
\item
  \(X \sim N(0,2)\), what percent of the distribution is above 2?
\item
  \(X \sim N(0,2)\), what percent of the distribution is above 3?
\item
  \(X \sim N(-2, 500)\), find the 75\% quantile (aka Q3).
\item
  \(X \sim N(3.14, 15.9)\), what proporion of values are between 2.71
  and 8.28?
\item
  Suppose 25\% of a normal distribution is below 0, and the mean of this
  distribution is 1. What's the standard deviation?\footnote{Hint: Find
    the z-score for Q1, then fill out the standardization formula with
    the values you have.}
\item
  What to Expect claims that the average baby weighs about 7.5 lbs, with
  a ``normal''\footnote{Normal as in ``usual'', not as in the normal
    distribution.} range of 5.8 to 10 lbs. If the ``normal'' range is
  defined as the middle 95\%, what is the standard deviation of birth
  weights?
\item
  You're asked to estimate the number of M\&M's in family-sized bags.
  You're pretty sure that they are normally distributed and you think
  the mean is 600. How do you go about guessing the sd? One way is to
  say that you think it's ``unlikely'' that there are more than 650
  M\&Ms in any given bag.\footnote{This is actually a very useful way to
    think about distributions, especially in Bayesian statistics.}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If ``unlikely'' = 10\%, that is, only 10\% of the bags have more
    than 650 M\&M's, what is the sd?
  \item
    If ``unlikely'' = 5\%, what is the sd?
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  In the population of Canadian women, what's the probability that a
  randomly selected woman is \emph{further than} 1.7 standard deviations
  from the mean?
\item
  There's a peculiar model that applies to certain kinds of data. If you
  have \(\mu = \sigma\), then the normal distribution has certain nice
  properties.\footnote{Sorry, the details are far beyond the scope of
    this course.} Suppose \(X\sim N(\theta, \theta)\), where \(\theta\)
  is just a stand-in for the mean and variance. If \(P(X < 8) = 0.2\),
  what is \(\theta\)?\footnote{This is one of the hardest questions you
    will encounter.}
\end{enumerate}

I'm going to say it again before you check the answers:
\textbf{Pre-emptively checking the answer destroys any chance of
learning and creates a false sense of knowledge.} You should spend time
struggling to convince yourself that you did it right. On an exam, you
won't have the answers so you'll feel that struggle. Practice the exam
struggle now, then you'll be more confident in your answer on exams.

Have you ever had that feeling that you knew the material because you
could do all of the practice problems, but when you get the exam you
forgot everything? \emph{That's because you checked the answers before
struggling.} You taught yourself to anticipate the answers of those
particular questions, rather than teaching yourself the material. The
struggling is where you learn. It's the same as exercise: no pain no
gain.

Probability models are ways of laying out all possible events as well as
the probability of each event. For things like coins and dice,
everything has the same probability and things work out nicely. In
Two-Way tables, we have all the probabilities laid out in front of us.
The Binomomial distribution is our first foray into a formulaic approach
to probabilities.

\hypertarget{with-coins}{%
\section{With Coins}\label{with-coins}}

If we flip two coins, the outcomes are \{HH, HT, TH, TT\} and each of
these are equally likely. Instead of looking at each event, what is the
probability that there are 0 heads? 1 head? 2 heads?

For 0 and 2 heads, there is only 1 possibility, so it must be 1/4 for
each. For 1 head, there are 2 possibilities, each with probability 1/4,
so the answer is 2*1/4.\footnote{Since these events are
  \textbf{disjoint}, we can simply add them.}

Let's flip three coins. The outcomes are \{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT,
TTH, TTT\}, so each outcome has a probability of 1/8. Another way to
come to this number is to look at the probability of heads: For HHH, the
probability is 0.5*0.5*0.5 since there's a 50\% chance of heads and each
coin flip is \textbf{independent}.\footnote{For coin flips, this is
  obvious. It won't always be!}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
\# Heads & Outcomes & Probability \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
0 & TTT & 1/8 \\
1 & TTH, THT, HTT & 1/8+1/8+1/8 = 3/8 \\
2 & HHT, HTH, THH & 3/8 \\
3 & HHH & 1/8 \\
\end{longtable}

Alright, let's do 4 coins. How many ways are there to get, say, 2 heads
out of four flips? You can bet that a smart mathemetician has figured
out a way to do this without writing them all out again! This is called
\emph{combinatorics}, and includes a lot of things that are not relevant
right now. We'll focus on the \textbf{choose} function. For three coins,
``3 choose 1'' means ``out of 3 options, choose 1 of them''. Sometimes
this is shortened to ``3C1''. As we saw in the table above, there's 1
way to choose nothing (no heads), 3 ways to choose 1 thing, 3 ways to
choose 2 things, and 1 way to choose 3 things.\footnote{And 0 ways to
  choose 4 things.} In R:

\begin{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 6
\end{verbatim}

So for 4 coins, there is 4C2 = 6 ways to get two heads.\footnote{Verify
  this by writing out all of the possibilities.} What's the probability
of each of these 6 outcomes? Since there's a 0.5 chance of heads and a
0.5 chance of tails, there's a 0.5*0.5*0.5*0.5 = 0.5\(^4\) = 0.0625
chance. That means that there's a 6*0.0625 = 0.375 chance of getting two
heads out of four flips.\footnote{Don't be afraid to re-read this
  paragraph several times, there's a lot of math here.}

Just to be complete, let's do this again for 5 coins. We're already at
the point where we \emph{need} the choose function because there are too
many outcomes to write out by hand. Let's calculate some probabilities
with R:

\begin{Shaded}

\section{With Dice}\label{with-dice}}

If I roll two dice, what's the probability that exactly 1 of them is a
3? One way this can happen is if the first dice is a 3 and the second
one is \emph{not} a 3. This probability is P(first dice is 3)*P(second
dice is not 3). We know that P(first dice is 3) is easily seen to be
1/6. On the other hand, P(second dice is not 3) can be calculated as 1 -
P(second dice is 3)\footnote{The dice is either 3 or it's not 3, these
  probabilities must add to 1.} = 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. So the probability is
(1/6)*(1 - 1/6).

We can also have exactly one 3 if the first dice is not 3 but the second
dice is 3. This has the same probability as the other way around: (1 -
1/6)*(1/6).

Notice how this is the second of two options. Again, we get to use the
choose function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{verbatim}

If we roll 18 dice, what's the probability that exactly four of them are
5? Regardless of the order, we have four dice that are 5 and 14 dice
that are not 5. The probability of any one of the outcomes is
(1/6)\(^4\)*(1 - 1/6)\(^{14}\) = 0.000060098. That's pretty unlikely for
this exact dice combination of dice rolls! But how many ways are there
for this to happen? There are 18C4 = 3060, which is a lot, so there are
a lot of opportunities for things with small probabilities. The
probability of exactly four 5s out of 18 rolls is
18C5*(1/6)\textsuperscript{4*(1-1/6)}14 = 0.1840. Even though an
individual dice roll is unlikely, there are a lot of dice rolls that
meet our criteria of four 5s out of 18 rolls!

\hypertarget{binomial-probabilities-1}{%
\chapter{Binomial Probabilities}\label{binomial-probabilities-1}}

In general, if we have \(n\) trials and the probability of the event of
interest, a.k.a. \textbf{success}, is \(p\), then

\begin{align*}
P(x\text{ successes in }n\text{ trials}) = nCx*p^x*(1-p)^{n-x}
\end{align*}

For the dice example, ``x successes in n trials'' can be interpreted as
``four 6s in 18 trials'', where \(x=4\), \(n=18\), and the ``14 rolls
that are not four'' comes from \(n-x=14\).

\hypertarget{confusing-but-useful-notation}{%
\section{Confusing (but Useful)
Notation}\label{confusing-but-useful-notation}}

In the statement above, we used \(x\) to refer to the number of heads. I
like this. Let's keep doing this.

For Binomial probabilities, we use the notation:

\begin{align*}
X \sim B(n,p)
\end{align*}

which is read as ``the random variable X is distributed as Binomial with
n trials and probability of success p''.\footnote{Notice how we're using
  upper case for the \textbf{random variable}, and lower case for the
  actual values. This is important for future stats classes, but just
  something you'll see me do for now.} The ``\(\sim\)'' just means ``is
distributed as'', which tells us where the probabilities are
distributed. This is why \(nCx*p^x*(1-p)^{n-x}\) is called the
\textbf{probability distribution function}, or pdf.\footnote{I usually
  use lower case so you don't confuse it with the PDF file extension.}

A \textbf{random variable} is just a variable that has a probability
distribution,\footnote{There's a much more correct, much more technical
  definition, but it's outside the scope of this course.} such as the
number of heads out of 5 flips. Before flipping these coins we have no
idea how many heads there will be, but we know the probability of each
number. We always use upper case letters for random variables. Once we
actually have a value (say, 1 heads), we use lower case. We often use
the notation \(P(X = x)\) to refer to ``the probability that the
\textbf{random variable} \(X\) will have the specific value of \(x\)''.
In other words, \(X\) is the unknown that could be anything, \(x\) is
the specific probability that we're interested in.

I just want to talk about ``distributions'' a little bit more. A
\textbf{distribution} tells you where the probabilities are. For coins,
50\% of the probability is in Heads, 50\% is in in tails. When we talk
about ``is the dice a 3?'', one-sixth of the probability is distributed
to the 3 and five-sixths are distributed elsewhere.

To summarise, saying that \(X \sim B(n,p)\), or that \(X\) is
distributed as a Binomial random variable with \(n\) trials and
probability of success \(p\), is the exact same as saying that
\(P(x\text{ successes in }n\text{ trials})\) can be found using the
equation \(nCx*p^x*(1-p)^{n-x}\). This is what it means to have a
\textbf{probability distribution function.}

To see all of these probabilities at once, we can plot this as a graph.
To reduce coding, let's look at \(X\sim B(3, 0.4)\):

Notice how 1 is the most likely value, with 2 being much less likely.
This makes sense - if the probability of heads is less than 0.5, we
expect that more of the coin flips will be tails! If the probability of
``heads'' were 0.5, then we would expect 1 and 2 to be equally likely.

What about the probability of \emph{at most} 40 heads in 100 flips? Do I
have to type all that out?

Nope! We can use the \texttt{pbinom()} function. First, let's verify it

The cdf always calculates ``less than or equal to''\footnote{P(X \(\le\)

\chapter{Properties of the Binomial
Distribution}\label{properties-of-the-binomial-distribution}}

I define ``math'' as the process of making up rules just to see what
happens. The Binomial distribution isn't just some abstract entity that
we discovered - it's a set of rules we created that seem to logically
fit some situations.\footnote{The philosophy of math is \emph{extremely}
  interesting. Most philosophers seem believe that we \emph{do} discover
  math, rather than create it. I also believe this, but probability
  distributions are in a grey area for this part of philosophy. When all
  this is over we should grab a drink and discuss this.} So first: what
are the rules?

\hypertarget{binomial-assumptions}{%
\section{Binomial Assumptions}\label{binomial-assumptions}}

I'm going to motivate these assumptions first. If you're the type that
just wants to memorize, you can skip to the end of this section.

We've been talking about flipping coins and rolling dice, which helped
motivate this distribution. We wouldn't be teaching you this
distribution if it only applied to dice and coins, so when can we apply
it?

Consider flipping a ``sticky'' coin twice. It starts with a 50/50 chance
of being heads, but the next flip has a 75\% chance of being the same as
the first.\footnote{If an engineer could make this coin for me I'd be
  infinitely grateful.} So if the first flip was heads, there's a 75\%
chance that the second flip will be heads. If the first flip was tails,
there's a 75\% chance that the second flip will be tails.

Let's first just calculate the probability of each outcome. The
probability that the first flip is heads \textbf{and} the second flip is
tails can be found using the \textbf{Multiplication Rule}, which states
that P(A and B) = P(A)P(B\textbar A). So P(HH) = P(first is H)P(second
is H \textbf{given that} the first was H) = 0.5*0.75 = 0.375. Similarly,
P(HT) = 0.125, P(TT) = 0.375, and P(TH) = 0.125.\footnote{Always make
  sure the numbers that I give you add to 1 - I will try and trick you
  with this!}

Let's compare these probabilities with the ones we calculated earlier.
The probability of 0 heads with the fair coin was 1/4, and this value
was calculated with the binomial distribution. With the sticky coin, the
probability of 0 heads is 0.375, which does \emph{not} come from the
binomial distribution.

Formally, the Binomial distribution \textbf{assumes} that each trial is
independent and the probability of success is the same in each trial.
While I didn't touch on this, the only random thing should be the number
of successes, \emph{not} the number of trials. Finally, recall that,
with the dice, I converted things to ``3'' or ``not 3''; the Binomial
distribution only works when each individual trial can only be one thing
or another. More succinctly, the \textbf{assumptions for the Binomial
Distribution} are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  There are n trials, and this number is known ahead of time.
\item
  Each trial is either a ``success'' or a ``failure''.
\item
  Each trial is \textbf{independent} of the other trials.
\item
  The probability of success is the same for all trials.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{side-note-probability-of-success-is-the-same}{%
\subsection{Side note: ``probability of success is the
same''}\label{side-note-probability-of-success-is-the-same}}

As an example, consider studying, say, the proportion of questions that
a student got right on a multiple choice test. Each student has a
different probability of getting each question correct. However, if we
want to say something about the proportion of questions that a
\emph{random} student gets right on a test. In this sense, the fourth
assumption is not violated.

As an alternative, consider a test where the students go
one-by-one\footnote{in a random order} and can see the previous
student's solutions. In this case, the probability of success changes as
you have more trials. This is where the problem lies - the students are
still coming in a random order, but the probability of success changes.

As another alternative, suppose some students are cheating. They're more
likely to get the right answers together, so they're answers are
\textbf{dependent} on each other; knowing one cheater's answer gives you
a better guess at another cheater's answer.

In summary, a different probability of success is only an issue if the
researcher would be able to know this ahead of time. If the probability
of success is different but we have a simple random sample with
independent trials, there is no issue with this assumption.

\hypertarget{binomial-mean-and-variance}{%
\section{Binomial Mean and Variance}\label{binomial-mean-and-variance}}

Now that we know the assumptions, we can see what comes out of these
assumptions. First, we can find the average value. It makes perfect
sense that the average number of heads in 10 flips should be 5. There's
a 50/50 chance of heads, so you'd expect half of the flips to be heads!
Formally, \(\mu = np\).\footnote{Why \(\mu\) and not \(\bar x\)? Because
  this is a \emph{theoretical} result. You can think of this as being
  the ``true'' population.} That is, the theoretical average is just the
number of trials times the probability of success.

What about the variance? It's not as obvious. I'm going to try and give
my own intuitive argument, but most teachers and textbooks simply skip
this and have you memorize the answer. If this is your style, you can
skip to the end of this section.

In the past, I have defined ``variance'' as something like ``the average
amount that you would be wrong if you always guessed the mean value.''
Consider flipping one coin. If this coin is rigged and always comes up
heads, the mean number of heads is 1 and you would always be right when
you guess the mean. Intuitively, the variance here is 0. The same
happens if the coin is rigged to always come up tails - the mean number
of heads is 0, and the number of heads never varies so the variance is
0.

What happens between 0 and 1? If the coin was heads 80\% of the time,
then your guess would be right 80\% of the time. The actual value of the
coin varies, but not too much. If the coin was heads 20\% of the time,
you'd still be right 80\% of the time by guessing 0 heads each time.
You'd be wrong \emph{most often} if the coin had a 50\% chance of being
heads.

So we've established this: At \(p=0\) and \(p=1\), the variance is 0.
The maximum value is at 0.5, and the variance should be the same if
you're 0.2 above 0.5 or 0.2 below (it's symmetric around 0.5). The
following plot, then, seems reasonable:

\includegraphics{L09-Binomial_Probabilities_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-16-1.pdf}

There's a lot of math behind this, but the variance for
Bin(1,p)\footnote{When n=1, this is also called the \emph{Bernoulli}
  distribution, but this is not important right now.} turns out to be
p(1-p). You can see that it would be symmetric around 0.5 and would be 0
whenever p=0 or p=1.

\textbf{In general, the variance of a B(n,p) distribution is
\(\sigma^2\) = np(1-p).}

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\chapter{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

If you have a known number of repeated trials that are independent and
are either a ``success'' or ``falure'', then the Binomial distribution
is your friend. Once these assumptions are met, you can calculate the
probability of any number of successes using the pdf, you know what the
mean number of successes in \(n\) trials will be, and you know the
variance!\footnote{\textbf{Statistics} is the study of variance.}

As a rule, if you see the phrase ``Not enough information for a valid
answer'' as an option in a multiple choice question, double check that
the assumptions are all met. If the observations are not independent,
you need to know all of the \textbf{conditional probabilities} in order
to calculate the answer, which you probably don't have, so you're
missing information. If the probability of success changes from trial to
trial, you need to know how it changes.

Please pay attention to the notes.\footnote{These things!} They often
contain important information.\footnote{Or silliness.}

\hypertarget{prelude-populations-and-samples}{%
\chapter{Prelude: Populations and
Samples}\label{prelude-populations-and-samples}}

The main idea in the rest of the course is this: We can use a sample to
say something about the population. Before we dive into that idea, let's
make a distinction.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Statistic:} A number that we calculate from data.
\item
  \textbf{Population parameter:} The value of a statistic if it were
  calculated for the whole population.
\item
  \textbf{Sample Statistic:} The value of a statistic if it were
  calculated for a single sample.
\end{itemize}

For example, we find the mean by taking all of the values and adding
them up, then dividing by the number of things we added. For heights of
Canadians, the population parameter is the value we would get if we
found every Canadians' height and added them up, then divided by the
population of Canada. We obviously can't do this, but it's useful to
think about. The sample mean is the mean we get when we just have a
sample. Since we can only get a sample, it would be super cool if we
could use that sample mean to talk about what values of the population
mean were reasonable guesses.

In the height example, the \textbf{population} was all Canadians. This
isn't always how we define the population! For example, if we wanted to
know the average length of pregnancy, we'd be looking at a population of
all people who get pregnant at some point in their lives.

\hypertarget{introduction-4}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction-4}}

You take a sample. You find the \textbf{sample mean}. Is this mean
\emph{exactly} equal to the \textbf{population mean}?\footnote{Recall:
  \textbf{population} refers to the population of interest. The
  \textbf{population mean} is the true mean of the population.} Probably
not.

Wait, did I just say \emph{probably} not? How probably? We've done a few
lectures on probability, so we can probably same describe the
distribution somehow. What is the probability that the sample mean is
within one standard deviation of the population mean? Two standard
deviations?

Because of random sampling error,\footnote{In statistics, error does
  \emph{not} mean mistake.} every sample is going to have a different
mean. We expect most of the sample means to be close to the population
mean, with fewer samples resulting in sample means that are further
away. In other words, the \textbf{sample mean} should be close to the
\textbf{population mean}, but due to \textbf{sampling error} there will
be a little bit of a difference.

The variation within our sample should be similar to the variation
within the population\footnote{Assuming we have a \textbf{good}
  sample**.}, and the variance in the poulation tells us the variance in
the sample means. Variation is not something to be afraid of, and
sampling errors are \emph{not} sampling \emph{mistakes}; we can harness
the variability within a sample to draw conclusions about the
population!

\hypertarget{sampling-distribution-of-the-sample-mean}{%
\chapter{Sampling distribution of the sample
mean}\label{sampling-distribution-of-the-sample-mean}}

Because the value of a sample mean is random (since we took a random
sample), there's a probability distribution that describes it. I could
just jump to the answer, but it's best if I build up to it.

The app below\footnote{If you don't have access to R right now, try this
  one.} will take a random sample from the population (in this case,
normal), then find the mean and add it to a histogram. As you collect
more means, the histogram gets more and more data. This simulates taking
many many different samples.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

    \AttributeTok{subdir =} \StringTok{"Apps/samplingDist"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Play around yourself! Start with \(n\) equal to 2 or 3. The sample shows
the individual values, but it also shows the sample mean. Notice how the
mean is usually closer to the population mean than any of the individual
sample values.

Now, take another sample! Again, the sample mean is closer to the
population mean than most of the sampled values. Take more samples. Take
1000 more samples. Notice how the distribution of sample means is
bell-shaped, but slightly skinnier than the population.

Repeat what you did above, but use n = 25 or so. The histogram of sample
means is even skinnier now! It's still centered on the population mean,
though!

These histograms are approximations to the \textbf{sampling distribution
of the sample mean.} If you take an infinite number of samples and
calculate the mean for each different sample, you'll get a distribution
of all possible sample means. This is what a \textbf{sampling
distribution} is. I'm going to repeat that, since this is often a very
difficult topic: the population distribution shows you the probability
distribution for all possible \emph{individuals}, while a sampling
distribution shows you the probability distribution for all possible
sample \emph{means}. Each sample has a different mean, the sampling
distribution describes many many samples.

\hypertarget{normal-populations}{%
\chapter{Normal Populations}\label{normal-populations}}

If the population is normal with mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation
\(\sigma\), then there is some relatively straightforward
math\footnote{You'll probably see it in the next stats course you take.}
to show that:

\[
\bar X \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
\]

That is, the distribution of all possible sample means\footnote{i.e.~the
  sampling distribution of the sample mean} is normal with the same mean
as the population, but with a smaller standard deviation. Go back to the
app and see this for yourself.

\hypertarget{example-1}{%
\section{Example}\label{example-1}}

Suppose the population of heights of Canadian women is N(162.3,
7.11).\footnote{Note: these numbers actually come from a sample, and we
  don't know that the population is normal. We're making some massive
  assumptions here.} We're going to try and build up some intuition for
why the distribution of all means has a smaller variance than the
distribution of the population.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The probability that a randomly chosen woman is taller than 170 cm is
  \(P(X > 170)\) =
  \texttt{1\ -\ pnorm(q\ =\ 170,\ mean\ =\ 162.3,\ sd\ =\ 7.11)} =
  0.139. So there's about a 14\% chance of finding a woman taller than
  170 cm.
\item
  (This is just for example - this question is not often
  important.\footnote{You will not need to do something like this on a
    test.}) If we take a sample of n=2 women, what's the probability
  that \emph{both} of them are taller than 170cm? If it's a truly random
  sample, then the heights of the two women should be independent and we
  can just multiply their probabilities.\footnote{Remember the most
    important fact from probability: Multiplying probabilities only
    works when they're independent.} This means that there's
  approximately 0.14\% chance of this. Obviously, if one woman taller
  than 170 is unlikely, then both women taller than 170 is very
  unlikely.
\item
  If we take a sample of n=2 women, what's the probability that their
  average height is larger than 170? From above, we know that the
  \textbf{distribution of the sample mean} is
  \(N(162.3, 7.11/\sqrt{2})\), so we can calculate this probability as
  \(P(\bar X > 170)\) =
  \texttt{1\ -\ pnorm(q\ =\ 170,\ mean\ =\ 162.3,\ sd\ =\ 7.11/sqrt(2))}
  = 0.06. This is somewhere in between \emph{just} one of them being
  taller than 170cm and \emph{both} of them being taller than 170.
\end{enumerate}

When we took a sample of 2 women, one might have been taller than 170
but one might have been shorter, so the average ends up being less than
170. The sample mean is \emph{less variable} than the individual values,
so it's less likely to be further away.\footnote{Take a moment and make
  sure you understand this relationship. Write out a description of it.
  Call a grandparent and try to explain it to them.}

\textbf{Summary:} If you take two values from a normal distribution, the
average of those two values is probably closer to the true mean than
either of the individual values. If you found the average of 100
observations from a normal distribution, the mean is probably even
closer to the true mean.

\hypertarget{non-normal-populations-with-large-sample-size}{%
\chapter{Non-Normal Populations with Large Sample
Size}\label{non-normal-populations-with-large-sample-size}}

In the previous example, we saw that a normal population distribution
will result in a distribution for all possible sample means that is also
normal, but with a smaller variance. If the population \emph{isn't}
normal, but you have a large enough sample size, the sampling
distribution is still normal. It's kind of amazing, but it seems to work
in practice!

The app below\footnote{Or the same app as before, with population set to
  Exponential.} will help you understand this relationship. I use an
``Exponential distribution'' for the population, but this isn't a
distribution you really need to worry about. All you need to know is
that the population \emph{clearly} isn't normal.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{shiny}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{runGitHub}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{repo =} \StringTok{"DBecker7/DB7\_TeachingApps"}\NormalTok{, }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Regardless of ``lambda''\footnote{Which controls how skewed the
  population distribution is.}, as n increase, the sampling distribution
becomes closer and closer to the normal distribution. By around n=30 or
40,\footnote{I will either ask you questions where n \textless{} 30
  (non-normal sampling distr.) or n \textgreater{} 50 (normal sampling
  distr.), nothing in between.} they're basically the same!\footnote{Although,
  in this case, the normal approximation is \textbf{biased}, but the
  bias decreases as n increases and you're not expected to know these
  details.}

Again,

\[
\text{If }X\sim N(\mu, \sigma)\text{ and n is ``large'', then }\bar X\sim N(\mu,\sigma/\sqrt{n})
\]

where 60 is definitely
\texttt{large\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{},\ 50\ is\ probably}large'`,
30 is debatably ``large'' (depending on what textbook you read), and
anything less than 30 is definitely small. I will not test you on the
grey areas here.

This result has a very special name:

\textbf{The Central Limit Theorem:} Given a simple random sample of size
\(n\) (where \(n\) is ``large'') from \emph{any} population with mean
\(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\), the sampling distribution of
the sample mean will follow a \(N(\mu, \sigma/\sqrt{n})\) distribution.

For a perfectly normal population, this is true for any \(n\). For a
population that just a little bit not normal, \(n\) must be moderately
large. For a very not normal population (e.g.~Binomial with \(p\) far
from 0.5), we need \(n\) even larger. Still, as long as the sd of the
population is finite, the sampling distribution will be normal for
sufficiently large \(n\)!

    between the two peaks. In other words, it won't be describing either

    fix errors in sampling.

    In this case, we would want to find out why there are two subgroups

Set n = 20 and find p such that np \textless{} 10. Also find p such that
n(1-p) \textless{} 10. What is the shape of the Binomial distribution in
these cases? What do you notice about the normal distribution? Why do
both np and n(1-p) need to be greater than 10?\footnote{Answers: Skewed;
  positive probability below 0 and above n; symmetric.}

\hypertarget{back-to-binomial}{%
\section{Back to Binomial}\label{back-to-binomial}}

It turns out that, with large \(n\) the sampling distribution of \(p\)
also follows a normal distribution!\footnote{Again, we use the rule of
  thumb that \(np>10\) and \(n(1-p)>10\).} Even though the population
distribution isn't even continuous,\footnote{This is important.} the
normal distribution approximates it well when there are lots of samples.

For each sample, the actual proportion that you calculate is variable.
You might get 3 heads out of 10 flips one time, then 8 heads out of 10
flips the next. On average, though, you'll get 5 heads out of 10 flips.
Formally, the mean of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion
is \(p\).\footnote{Not n*p, since the proportion of heads is x/n.}

The variance is a little trickier. In the Binomial lecture notes, I said
that the variance increases as n increases. However, when we calculate
the proportion, we take the number of successes divided by n.~According
to some math that is not important for this course, this leads to a
\textbf{variance of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion}
of p(1-p)/n, which means that the \textbf{standard deviation}\footnote{Which
  is simply the square root of the variance.} \textbf{of the sampling
distribution} is \(\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}\).

To recap: The variance of a Binomial distribution is \(np(1-p)\). If we
take repeated samples from that Binomial distribution and calculate the
proportion of sucesses, the variance will be \(p(1-p)/n\).\footnote{Notice
  how they're equal when n = 1. When n=1, we're just taking individuals
  from the population and calling each individual a sample.}

\hypertarget{example-2}{%
\section{Example}\label{example-2}}

Suppose I'm rolling a dice 5 times. The probability of exactly 2 ones is
defined by the Binomial distribution:
\texttt{dbinom(2,\ size\ =\ 5,\ prob\ =\ 1/6)} = 0.16.\footnote{In other
  words, 2 successes in 5 trials, where a success is defined as
  ``rolling a one''.} The variance in the number of ones in 5 rolls is
np(1/p) = 5/36.

The average number of ones in 5 rolls is np=5/6. The standard deviation
of the number of ones in 5 rolls is \(\sqrt{np(1-p)} = \sqrt{5/36}\).

In both of the sampling distributions above, the mean of the sampling
distribution was the mean of the population. The difference between the
population and the sampling distribution is the \textbf{variance}. In
both sampling distributions, the variance \emph{decreases} as n
\emph{increases}. If you sample the entire population every time you do
a sample, there will be no variance in your estimate!

\section{Probability vs.~Inference}\label{probability-vs.-inference}}

In probability, we have distributions and calculate how likely given
values are. In inference, we have a value that came from a distribution
and try to determine things about that distribution.

Recall: Sampling Distributions

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the population is \(N(\mu,\sigma)\), the sampling distribution of
  the sample mean is \(\bar X\sim N(\mu,\sigma/\sqrt{n})\).
\item
  Assuming an SRS, 95\% of sample means should be within
  2\(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\) of the population mean.\footnote{This is using
    the empirical rule - the actual value is closer to 1.96.}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{flippin-it-confidence-intervals}{%
\section{Flippin' it: Confidence
intervals}\label{flippin-it-confidence-intervals}}

Instead of asking ``What's the probability that a sample mean is further
than 2\(\sigma\) away?'', we can ask ``If your sample mean is further
than 2\(\sigma\), is it reasonable to say that it comes from that
particular population?''

Notice the subtle shift - we're now talking about something that we can
do with \emph{just a sample}. The Sampling Distributions section always
assumed that the population mean was known and told us about potential
sample means. We're now shifting our perspective: given a sample mean,
what are the potential population values?

The basic idea in this lecture is as follows: the sample should be
similar to the population but a little bit off. What are the potential
values of the population mean that are compatible with what we observed?

\hypertarget{confidence-intervals}{%
\chapter{Confidence Intervals}\label{confidence-intervals}}

\hypertarget{background}{%
\section{Background}\label{background}}

Given data, we want to make an \textbf{inference} about the population.
Since \(P(\bar X = \mu) = 0\), we can't just calculate the probability
that we have the correct population mean. It's always going to be 0!

However, we can make guesses based on ranges! With confidence intervals,
we create a range around our estimate that (hopefully) contains the true
population mean. It won't contain the true mean every time, but if we do
things right, we can quantify our \textbf{confidence} that it does.

All CI's that we learn in this class have the form: \[
\text{Estimate} \pm \text{Margin of Error}
\]

\hypertarget{the-margin-of-error-moe}{%
\section{The Margin of Error (MoE)}\label{the-margin-of-error-moe}}

If the population is normal with mean \(\mu\) and sd \(\sigma\), then
the \textbf{Margin of Error} is

\[
MoE = (z^*)*(\sigma/\sqrt{n}) = \text{Critical Value}*\text{Standard Error}
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(z^*\) is a \textbf{critical value}. This is where we get our
  ``confidence'' from. This value is \emph{always positive}.
\item
  \(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\) is the standard deviation of the sampling
  distribution, which is also called the \textbf{Standard Error}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{critical-values}{%
\section{Critical Values}\label{critical-values}}

If \(z^* = \infty\), it means that the confidence interval is infinitely
wide. That is, we're 100\% confident that the true population mean is in
the interval!

If \(z^* = 0\), it means the CI is just the \textbf{point estimate}. In
other words, we're 0\% confident.

Usually, we choose a confidence level in between 0 and 100. Values of
90\%, 95\%, or 97.5\% are common. This values strike a nice balance
between being useful and being less than infinity.

\hypertarget{calculating-critical-values-0.95}{%
\section{Calculating critical values:
0.95\%}\label{calculating-critical-values-0.95}}

If \(X\sim N(\mu, \sigma)\), then the sampling distribution is
\(\bar X\sim N(\mu,\sigma/\sqrt{n})\).

WTo make a confidence interval, we want a range of values \((L, U)\)
such that \(P(L < \bar X < U) = 0.95\).

The normal distribution is symmetric. If we want 95\% in the middle,
then we need 0.025 below L and 0.025 above U. This is equivalent to
values such that \(P(\bar X < L) = 0.025\) and
\(P(\bar X < U) = 0.975\).

We can find \(P(Z < -z^*) = 0.025\), then use the formula
\(x = z\sigma+\mu\). However, since we're using \(\bar X\) instead
(which has a standard deviation of \(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\) instead of
\(\sigma\)), this is \(\bar x = z^*\sigma/\sqrt{n} + \mu\).

We can do the same with \(P(Z < z^*) = 0.975\) and find
\(\bar x = z^*\sigma/\sqrt n + \mu\).

\hypertarget{what-is-z}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{What is
\(z^*\)?}{What is z\^{}*?}}\label{what-is-z}}

For \(P(\bar X < L) = 0.025\), \(-z^* = -1.96\) (almost -2).

For \(P(\bar X < U) = 0.975\), \(z^* = 1.96\) (almost 2).\newline

In other words, it's symmetric! The two ends of the interval are: \[
\bar x = \pm z^*\sigma/\sqrt{n} + \mu
\]

However, we don't know the population mean. Instead, we have \(\bar x\).

A CI is defined as: \[
\mu \text{ is in the range } \bar x \pm z^*\sigma/\sqrt{n}
\]

\hypertarget{some-notation-alpha}{%

A \((1-\alpha)\%\)CI is is defined as \[

\]

where \(P(Z < z^*) = \alpha/2\).\newline

\begin{itemize}

\item
  For a 95\%CI, \(\alpha = 0.05\) and \(\alpha/2= 0.025\).

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    \(z^*\) is found by finding the value such that
    \(P(Z <z^*) = 0.025\).
  \item
    \texttt{qnorm(0.025)} = -1.96, so \(z^* = 1.96\).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  For a 89\%CI, \(\alpha = 0.11\) and \(\alpha/2 = 0.055\).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{qnorm(0.055)} = -1.59819, so \(z^* = 1.6\).

  \begin{itemize}

  \end{itemize}
\item
  By the way the CI is constructed, it will contain the population mean
  95\% of the time. We have no idea whether any particular one does, but
  95\% of them do.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    On any given day, there's a 10\% chance of rain. However, it either
    rained yesterday or it didn't. There's \textbf{not} a 10\% chance
